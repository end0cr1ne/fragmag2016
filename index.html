            <div class="coll2">After umpteen brainstorming sessions and hours of deliberation, hoping to get our minds
                fixated
                on ‘the perfect’ theme for Fragmag 2016, we finally zeroed in on this beautiful word—‘Kairos’.
                ‘Kairos’ is a Greek word denoting ‘the right or opportune moment’. According to ancient Greek
                mythology, Kairos, the youngest son of Zeus, was also the Greek god of opportunity. He was lithe,
                swift on his feet and had a characteristic tuft of hair across his forehead. He could be seizedby his
                forelock as he approached, but once he raced ahead, it was impossible to get hold of him, the rest
                of his head being completely bald. He therefore served as a paradigm for—‘Seize the opportunity’,
                reminding us to make the most of the chances that come our way, most of the time, unanticipated.
                “There are moments which mark your life.
                Moments when you realize nothing will ever be the same,
                And time is divided into two parts – before this, and after this.”
                —John Hobbes
                Kairosis the time of expectation and excitement; it is an indefinite window of opportunity,
                also called ‘God’s time’, which lasts for a few fugacious moments, but leaves an ingrained
                impression on one’s life.For some, it maybe the time they turned the corner to succeed in their
                endeavors, for some,an epiphany that changed their life, while for most others, thetime when
                they claspedpromising opportunities.
                All of us have experienced certain kairotic moments that have been
                etched into our memories, making it possible for us to relate to the theme
                and interpret it in our own way. The Editorial Board thus believed that
                ‘Kairos’ was a befitting theme for this year’s edition. The overwhelming
                response we have received from everyone has only ascertained our belief.
                We hold extreme pride in being called the English
                Editors of our precious college magazine and being apart
                of the Editorial Board—a coalescence of
                creativity, talent and zeal. We are highly
                impressed seeing the diversity in the topics
                people touched on for this particular theme,
                right from philanthropy and feminism
                to politics; many have also shared their
                personal experiences that brought
                smiles to our faces. Working on
                their writings has been an incredible
                experience, and taking a peek into
                everyone’s minds has been
                wonderful. None of this would
                have been possible without
                the constant encouragement
                and wholehearted support of
                Prof. Tisha Jose.
                We hope you
                enjoy reading the
                magazine as much as
                we enjoyed
                putting it
                together.
                Happy
                Reading

            <div class="english-title">THE RIGHT MOMENT</div>
            <div class="coll2">When the theme of Fragmag
                2016—“Kairos”, was first introduced
                to everyone, it really intrigued me, having
                heard this word before but not knowing what
                it really meant. I went back home and after
                researching a lot about it, came across this: “A
                moment in time or a timeframe in which God
                makes it possible for something of lasting
                importance or significance to happen”.
                Sometimes the word kairos is
                translated colloquially as “God’s timing”.
                And I suddenly realized that although the
                word may be unfamiliar to me, the concept
                predominantly existed in our lives. Now let
                me first narrate a simple story.
                Once upon a time when the kings
                ruled our country, in one such kingdom, a
                couple was blessed with twin boys. They were
                raised with a lot of love and affection, and
                eventually grew up to be fine and talented
                young men. It was now time for them to step
                out of their house and start earning a living.
                Both the brothers had a knack for trading,
                and hence joined an established trader as his
                apprentices. One fine day, the trader wanted
                either of the brothers to travel to another
                kingdom far away and sell cotton. Knowing
                that cotton was not an expensive commodity
                and that it would only fetch them negligible
                profits, the first brother refused. The second
                brother however, agreed and started out on
                his journey the very next day. The second
                brother successfully completed the work
                assigned to him and on his return, both the
                brothers got married.
                A few months later, both the brothers
                were offered to travel and sell ivory. This
                time, the first brother enthusiastically
                accepted the offer, but suddenly
                his wife fell severely ill and was on her
                deathbed, and so the assignment landed
                on the second brother’s shoulders yet
                again.
                The third time, the trader wanted
                one of the brothers to travel and sell rubies,
                emeralds and gold. Since the commodities
                were valuable, he wanted to confer it to
                someone trustworthy. Having proven his
                worth twice to the trader, the second
                brother was chosen this time. By then, the
                second brother with his skills had established
                enough trading relationships. On returning
                from the third assignment, he resigned from
                his apprenticeship and went on to set up his
                own flourishing business. The first brother
                however, remained an assistant forever.
                Looking at the above story, many
                of you may feel that circumstances did not
                favour the poor first brother. But haven’t
                circumstances always favoured the ones who
                make the best of them? In life, our innermost
                sensibility always urges us to wait. We wait,
                out of greed, for better opportunities. We
                wait, out of ego, to make peace with a loved
                one, or to tell someone that we love them.
                We wait, out of fear, to speak up against
                injustice, hoping it will subside eventually. We
                wait, always for the right moment, for God’s
                timing. The harsh truth is that, distances will
                only grow, injustice will only rise. We forget
                that our biggest opportunity to do something
                right is now.
                Our Kairos is NOW.

            <div class="coll2">Dearest Laxmi,
                I am an indigent woman who was
                only capable of giving you life, and my
                reminiscences through this letter. I can
                apprehend your abhorrence of the term
                mother, which I certainly do not deserve to
                be called after having abandoned you on the
                doorsteps of your orphanage. However, with
                the anticipation that my words will somehow
                recuperate our relationship established and
                broken by your umbilical cord, I write to you
                the first and the last letter of my life.
                I was the consequence of one of
                the many unreported gang rapes on a
                dispossessed woman, who was awarded
                insanity for her incessant efforts of trying
                to file a police complaint. As I grew walking
                naked on the streets of Mumbai, I witnessed
                my mother’s resolve disintegrate to lunacy.
                One such day while she was murmuring
                curses, tearing her tangled hair, draped in
                a disheveled sari, she barked at a distant
                man who carried away her daughter, but
                did nothing to impede the kidnapping. I
                was touched, molested and penetrated.
                But fed, clothed and sheltered. Eventually
                I learnt that the punishment of escape was
                not worth the freedom. It was easier to have
                been compensated for discordant sex, than
                to have sought justice for it, in India. With
                that comprehension I deliberated on an
                occupation for my diurnal idleness. I would
                travel in the Mumbai locals, from Churchgate
                to Virar and back. In search for an exultant
                and peaceful woman, in whose skin I
                could imagine myself every night while
                satiating the carnal needs of my client.
                The agony of that excruciating
                activity was subdued as I floated
                in my imagination, somewhat
                like my own alternative
                reality. Dressed in
                civilized clothes, I would ceaselessly hunt
                for my muse, follow her, investigate, try to
                initiate a conversation, and sincerely hoped
                that she would illustrate what being happy
                felt like. With the commencement of my
                quest, I was first deceived by the smiles of
                Gauri, snuggling her infant in her sari like he
                weighed nothing, while she advertised her
                collection of cheap bangles and earrings.
                For many nights I smiled like her in my
                imaginary parallel universe until I gathered
                some courage to talk to her. She was traded
                (she refuses to call it marriage) by her father
                for a sum of Rs. 2500 to a chronic alcoholic
                who survived on her income and her body.
                Unlike me she had learnt to paste a grin on
                her scarred face for the sake of her children.
                Regardless of my heartbreak, I recommenced
                my chase. And in that expedition encountered
                scores of Goddesses like Gauri existing in
                their nonexistent lives. Saraswati, commuting
                daily to drop her son to school, was a middleclass
                housewife serving her husband and inlaws,
                in spite of their tormenting taunts, for
                the insubstantial dowry that she brought into
                the marriage. An unwanted daughter and a
                burden on her family, she was literate but
                not educated, because her parents believed
                that cooking and child-rearing were the only
                skills she needed. Nevertheless her laughter
                was capable of concealing years of neglect. I
                also met Durga, a fearless female constable
                whose valiance I aspired. I saw her detain
                thieves and thrash eve-teasers outside
                Bandra station, but it never crossed my mind
                that her gallantry came with a cost. Her
                working hours deteriorated her family life
                and as it was almost impossible to ascend the
                career ladder as a woman police officer, she
                deliberated resigning. Then I met Sita and
                Radhika, both were aspiring doctors.
                They were by far the most cheerful
                girls I had met. Sita committed
                suicide that August, after she
                failed to clear her AIPMT
                exams for the second
                time. But Radhika believed
                it was also because she was
                body-shamed for a long time
                by the boy she had a crush on. It’s
                incomprehensible how women hold
                such trivialities in high regard. Fortunately
                all prostitutes skinny or otherwise earned
                equal business. Anyway, Radhika remained
                the inspiration of my imagination for the
                longest period of time. She was a bold,
                beautiful, well-educated and mature girl,
                who had a wealthy, loving family and a lover
                who respected her. She only ceased to be my
                muse when she told me she had stage two
                breast cancer. This was around the same time
                I discovered I was pregnant. I was devastated
                by both, the knowledge of my pregnancy
                and the realization that for an Indian woman,
                there is no alternative reality. She just has one
                reality and that is the universe she is born in.
                And my love, the universe you were going
                to be born in would kill your soul before it
                would liberate your body. The orphanage is
                your parting gift. A door to a different, if not
                a better life.
                Laxmi, I also want you to know
                that I never contemplated an abortion
                because those nine months were the most
                enlightening days of my life. In India we are
                taught to worship our Goddesses for their
                angelic beauty, fertility, fidelity, compassion,
                and unrelenting capacity to love and sacrifice.
                Be it my mother, who lives an anonymous
                life of a lunatic or a glamorous model,
                who dies of drug abuse, we as women are
                expected to meet numerous unrealistic and
                impractical anticipations of other women,
                men and society as a whole. We are named
                as Goddesses, expected to behave like one,
                but seldom treated like one. However, your
                perspective will decide whether you curse a
                mountain for being an obstacle, stare at its
                stark magnificence, or climb it. I chose
                to stare. You can climb it. People will
                envy you, hate you, outcast you, chastise
                you, but they cannot pull you down if
                you don’t let them. Your birth reminds me
                of a concept introduced to me by Radhika;
                “Kairos”. It is the moment when everything
                happens. People let time and circumstances
                define their Kairos. But the day you gather
                courage to define your ‘everything’, you will
                be everything. I have not named you after
                the Goddess of wealth, but after the queen
                of Jhansi. I want you, not to believe in an
                alternate reality, but to alter your reality.
                Happy 16th birthday.
                Love,
                Sati.

            <div class="english-title">THE THIRD</div>
            <div class="coll2">It was a cold December morning. I was
                on my way to my aunt’s place in Churchgate.
                It was the end of my fifth semester and I
                was ecstatic about spending my Christmas
                vacation with my cousins. We get along like
                a house on fire! I packed my belongings and
                boarded an early morning local to Churchgate
                from Mira Road. Earphones plugged in,
                listening to my favourite FM channel, all I
                could think of was the fun that awaited me.
                It had been a year since I last met them, and
                I was really looking forward to this trip. As
                the train halted at Dahisar, a young woman
                boarded the train. She was amazingly welldressed;
                with her perfectly draped sari and
                matching jewelry she looked beautiful. It took
                me a while to realize that she was a transgender.
                I saw her walking towards me. I knew
                she would ask for money like they usually did,
                so I pretended to be asleep. She came and
                sat right beside me and I heard a shrill voice
                say, “Don’t worry, I won’t beg from you”. I
                was surprised. I slowly opened my eyes and
                looked at her. She smiled, I smirked in return.
                “Where are you heading to?”, she asked me
                after a while.
                “Churchgate”, I replied. “What about you?”
                “Same! I have an interview there.”
                As soon as I heard this, I couldn’t resist but
                ask,”Interview?”
                She nodded in agreement. I could see
                the excitement in her eyes. She began to tell
                me her story. Then began the conversation I
                will never forget.
                Gunjan was born in Chennai as a boy
                named Sharat. He belonged to a normal
                middle class family and had two elder sisters.
                His parents were very keen on their children’s
                education so they put him in an all boys’
                school. As he grew a little older, he realized
                that he had a lot of effeminate characteristics
                which soon caught society’s eye. “Behave
                like a boy”, the world told him. He had to
                face a lot of bullying, verbal abuses and was
                the butt of all jokes in school. He had no
                friends. It was a nightmare to go to school
                every single day and face so much criticism.
                There were times he used to run to the school
                washroom and sob uncontrollably. After a lot
                of contemplation, he realized that he wasn’t
                living the life he wanted. His parents did not
                understand him. At a young age of 14, he
                packed his bags, ran away from home and
                came to Mumbai.
                With only Rs.20 in his pocket,
                he reached Bandra terminus. He
                was scared and helpless, and on
                that very day he met a transgender
                named Menka who
                offered him a water
                bottle, heard his story and took him to her
                place. Menka was a social activist and fought
                for the rights of the trans-gender community.
                She understood Sharat’s plight and was like
                a mother to him. She supported his decision
                to become a woman. And thus Sharat
                transitioned into Gunjan. Gunjan became
                a part of the ‘hijra samaj’. After two years,
                she called her parents up to let them know
                where she was. But sadly they did not accept
                her. She still craves for their love. However,
                she did not get dejected. Instead, she made
                a firm resolution to make her mark in this
                world. She always knew that education was
                very important. To fund her education, she
                began begging in the local trains and at traffic
                signals by morning, and dancing in a bar at
                night. After she collected enough money, she
                decided to join a night college and complete
                her MCom. This was going to be her sixth
                interview.
                “There is a lot of stigma and
                discrimination. They think we misbehave and
                are rude. But it’s not entirely our fault. They
                never accepted us; they do not give us jobs.
                That’s why my sisters have to beg. My gender
                does not describe me as a person”, her story
                brought tears to my eyes. I quickly wiped
                them and scanned around to see whether
                anyone was looking. I think she saw that.
                “But I know I will get this job. It’s my
                lucky day today and I’m wearing my lucky
                sari!” I pretended to laugh, but deep down,
                my heart was filled with empathy. As we
                reached our destination, I waved goodbye
                and as I walked outside the train station, I
                made a silent prayer, hoping she gets the
                job.
                How deeply stuck we are to
                our preconceived notions baffles
                me. How easily we treat
                trans-gender people
                as outcasts and call
                them names. On April
                2014, the Indian Supreme
                Court declared trans-gender
                the third gender. It’s almost a year
                since the ruling and we still treat them
                so inhumanly. They are still looked down on
                and are sometimes deprived of basic human
                rights. The ‘hijras’ are not just the ones
                who clap and beg for money or the ones
                who perform at ceremonies for good luck.
                They are normal people with problems, just
                like us. This was my ‘Kairos’. The moment I
                realized that I must not judge anyone on the
                basis of their gender, caste, race or creed. It
                is their inner beauty that matters. I believe
                that one day we will live in a country where
                trans-gender people will be accepted, loved
                and most importantly respected. Let’s start
                today. Yes, it will take a long time but it’s not
                impossible.
                I never met Gunjan after our train
                encounter, but every time I board a
                Churchgate train, I look out for her hoping to
                hear that she got the job.

            <div class="coll2">As I look back at my life I realize
                that, every time I have been rejected from
                something good, I have actually been
                redirected to something better. Yes. Life is
                always at some “TURNING POINT”. Every
                successful person definitely has a turning
                point.
                An APPLE falling from a tree inspired
                Newton to discover the Laws of Motion.
                Overflow of WATER from a bath
                tub, observed by Archimedes, gave the
                world his Principles of Fluid Mechanics.
                A moving SPIDER on the wall helped
                a young Rene Descartes to fulfill his dream of
                merging Algebra and Geometry as Analytical
                Geometry.
                Taxi NUMBER 1729 was the spark in
                the life of Srinivasa Ramanujan that made him
                the unmatched hero of Number Theory.
                Everyone has a break point, turning
                point, stress point. But what matters is how
                best these points are understood and utilized
                to transform life towards SUCCESS. Life is
                unpredictable. Falling is a part of life. Getting
                up is living. The turning point can come at
                the age of 15 or 50. It is like the SUNRISE
                that provides a safe and bright atmosphere
                filled with hope and confidence. If we wait
                too long, we will miss it. It is a tool to fight
                the past and build the future. When we focus
                on PROBLEMS we will have more problems.
                When we focus on POSSIBILITIES we will get
                more opportunities. Use every opportunity
                as an HOURGLASS to let the sufferings run
                down and Disappear.
                Never close the door on an opportunity.
                If it knocks on the door, always say YES, and
                then try to learn how to make the best use of
                it. It comes to those who are prepared. Our
                NO will become a YES to someone else. Many
                of us miss it due to misperception. When a
                wave comes, go deep and never get scared.
                When we are in the midst of fear, and stop
                at the dead end of our path, sometimes we
                hear a voice saying, ‘do not lose hope, have
                faith in yourself and move forward, come
                whatever may’ .Today is not just another day.
                It is a new chance, another BEGINNING.
                Embrace it. Nothing is worse than missing an
                opportunity that can change your life.
                It is never too late to start over. If we
                are not happy with yesterday, try something
                different today and do better. A PESSIMIST
                sees the difficulty in an opportunity. An
                OPTIMIST sees the opportunity in every
                difficulty. All of us do not have equal talents.
                But all of us have an equal opportunity to
                develop our talents. We do not have to be
                great to start, but we have to start to become
                great. The ladder of SUCCESS is best climbed
                by stepping on the rings of opportunity.
                Many of life’s failures are because we do not
                realize how close we are to success when we
                give up.
                Our future is created on, what we DO
                TODAY and NOT TOMORROW.
                Life is like FOOTBALL. We have to
                tackle our problems, block our fears and
                score goals whenever we get the opportunity.
                Sometimes, LATER becomes NEVER. Making
                life big is scary, but what is even scarier is
                REGRET. We must use obstacles as the
                stepping stones to build the life we want.
                The PAIN we feel today is the STRENGTH
                we will feel tomorrow. For every challenge
                encountered, there is an opportunity for
                GROWTH. Take an oath:
                This moment, this day is as good as any
                moment. I shall make this day a HEAVEN on
                earth.
                The ADVENTURE of life is to LEARN
                The PURPOSE of life is to GROW
                The NATURE of life is to CHANGE
                The CHALLENGE of life is to
                OVERCOME
                The SECRET of life is to dare.
                Trust that God brings every
                person, every opportunity
                into our life to get us
                what we want
                and to where we need to be. Let every
                moment be a TURNING POINT that leads to
                success and happiness in life.

            <div class="english-title">NO OFFENCE MATE!</div>
            <div class="coll2">‘Freedom isn’t a tea party, India. Freedom is
                a war.’
                A war against the constant attempts
                to derail democracy, a war against the
                macabre slaughter of reason, a war against
                the barbaric ideals and beliefs with the
                solitary purpose of thwarting and shunting
                growth which manage to survive under the
                guise of rights and liberties, and a war to let
                an idea, a thought to exist and see its day
                without being assaulted and forced behind
                the gates of bans, its only offence being
                guilty of offending someone.
                Taking offence has become one
                of those ineluctable fashion fads which
                supersede one another, always to serve as a
                subject of grave concern for the impuissant
                majority, seeking those precious fifteen
                minutes to star in their “breaking news” and
                hog the offended posters. Shedding crocodile
                tears and feigning distress about things
                people rarely comprehend is sadly in vogue
                today. Society in the current decade, which
                has seen a huge change in power dynamics,
                has certainly become more regressive as
                it assumed the role of being the upholder
                of tradition. People either want their way
                or the ban way. The government too, has
                shown little resistance in letting people
                have their way. The entire process of
                taking offence is initiated by the
                powerless, who coveting the
                media limelight, yell offence
                and have a phalanx of dolts
                at the ready, armed
                with ink, which
                coincidentally is the
                ammunition of literary
                battles. The ban of literary
                genius Salman Rushdie’s Satanic
                Verses, the forced exile of the well
                renowned painter M.F. Hussain, the ban on
                beef and the arrest of comedian Kiku Sharda
                over the lampoon of a self-proclaimed
                divine messenger in a snazzy costume are
                the frivolous and ridiculous schemes of the
                vain and self-interested political leaders
                yearning to please the offended for their
                treasured vote bank. The media joins in
                the bandwagon with their prime time slots
                reserved for the ban-yelling, ink-wielding,
                FIR-lodging, office-ransacking, “outraged
                and offended” .Take for instance the AIB
                roast. Newspapers printed a great many
                useless and exaggerated things with the sole
                purpose of drawing attention to themselves
                and out-shouting the others. Celebrities
                thronged in to dish out their views to ensure
                not to be left out. TV reporters made it a
                point to do their duty of getting a bite from
                every offended person except for dear India
                TV that religiously aired their coverage of
                levitating mountains and self-incinerating
                phoenixes. All this hullaballoo when the
                creators explicitly warned the feeble hearted
                to avoid the episode!
                In this chronic upsurge of taking
                offence, the ones who leap in the forefront
                are the ministers without ministries, the
                journalists without stories, the aunties
                without gossip, bulging middle-aged men
                in shorts and the hypocritical god men with
                misunderstood scriptures. With an army at
                their disposal, the only way to stop them
                from getting offended is to offend them even
                more until we drain the very last bit of offence
                from them. The hour, the minute we decide
                to drive this flaw out from our society, we will
                take a giant step towards making this country
                the heaven of freedom spoken about
                by Rabindranath Tagore. So let’s make
                this our ‘kairotic moment’. Go Grab your
                pens and flaunt your inked faces while
                keeping in mind what Aristotle said, ‘It is
                the mark of an educated mind to be able to
                entertain a thought without accepting it’.

                “The birds of hope are everywhere, listen to
                them sing.”
                -Terri Guillemets
                When I first came across these
                powerful words, I did not fully understand
                their significance as I continued being tugged
                and pulled by the ebb and flow of life. As
                is the case with most of us, I rarely paused
                to stop and think about personal tragedies
                that occur to others. In the past, my normal
                reaction was to express meaningless, unfelt
                sympathy and to carry on chasing my dreams
                and ambitions. In short, I would get sucked
                into the vortex of my every day, fast-paced
                life. I was not really affected by the personal
                tragedies of others, nor did I realize the
                enormity of the situation. It was only when I
                saw at close quarters, how two families close
                to me, coped with their immense problems
                and responded to them, that I realized how
                my perspective was narrow, selfish and
                limited.
                In the first instance, there was this
                neighbor of mine, who died of a progressively
                debilitating illness called Parkinson’s disease.
                After battling with it for over sixteen years,
                he finally breathed his last. This individual’s
                encounter with Parkinson’s also became the
                family’s war against it. I saw with admiration,
                how each member rallied round the patriarch
                and gave him all their love, care and emotional
                support unflinchingly. Of course, it took a toll
                on their finances and severely restricted their
                lifestyles, but they carried on uncomplaining.
                In another poignant case, I saw true
                love, dedication and commitment shine
                through. This is the true story of a young
                woman, let me call her Sona. She had a loving
                husband and two lovely children. She had a
                shining career, was deeply involved with the
                progress of her children, and looked after her
                family, including her father-in-law. However,
                her normal existence came to a stop when
                she was felled by a tragic stroke. In the
                blink of an eye, the entire family’s life came
                crashing down. She lay in a deep coma for
                over three weeks, and the doctors did not
                hold out much hope. When she did emerge
                from her coma, I saw that she was fated to
                lead a bed-ridden life of dependence. The
                slightest movements like hugging and kissing
                her children, or speaking to them became
                impossible tasks. My heart went out to her
                husband and children for their lives were
                shattered. Life, in my opinion, had become a
                sheer drudgery for them.
                When I looked at both the families, I
                was acutely aware of the hopelessness of the
                situation. When I saw the sufferings of the
                individuals as well as those of their loved ones,
                I privately thought that blissful death would
                be preferable to a living death. When death
                finally claimed the life of my neighbor,
                who was suffering from Parkinson’s, I
                thought it was a blessed relief for all
                those concerned. However, I revised
                this opinion a few years later,
                when I saw beautiful, vivacious
                Sona and her family fight for
                normalcy in their lives.
                As the months and years passed by,
                I became aware of a lighter atmosphere
                pervading the house, as they rejoiced in her
                minor triumphs towards progress. I saw the
                single-minded devotion and purpose with
                which her husband contributed towards it,
                ungrudgingly nursing her and carrying out
                his responsibilities as a father and head of
                the family. I saw the children put aside their
                wants and desires and always considered
                their mother’s needs. Sona did not give way
                to despair, despondency or depression. She
                worked hard for the slightest improvement
                in her condition! She listened to everyone’s
                troubles, gave them advice and consoled
                them, when the others ought to have been
                doing it to her. She had come a long way, and
                as the years passed by, she still continued
                to be her level-headed, cheerful self. All this
                was possible because of her whole-hearted
                co-operation, her intense faith in God and
                her hope of regaining the ability to walk, talk
                and be independent.
                That was my moment of illumination,
                my supreme ‘Kairos’ of awareness. I realized
                that though life might be unjust and not
                work out the way we want it to, when we ask
                for something immediately and it does not
                always come; despite the odds, despite the
                hopelessness, we have to battle on. How one
                does it depends on the individuals concerned.
                One could give up the fight, become nasty
                and self-centered, or as is the case with Sona
                and my neighbour, one could find a way out
                and face the odds cheerfully without railing
                at fate or God.
                To turn adversity into hope is the
                lesson of life I learnt. Now I fully understand
                and appreciate the message contained
                in the following evergreen words of
                comfort and inspiration:
                “Whispering hope, oh how
                welcome thy voice
                Making my heart in its
                sorrow rejoice”
                Our lives are infused with
                pain and suffering. Hope enables us
                to overcome hardship, motivates us to
                persevere despite the darkness, reassures
                us and encourages us to journey onwards,
                despite obstacles and despite not knowing
                how, or when, or where, or why. Our life’s story
                will conclude. Hope is a signature strength
                that improves our well-being; providing peace
                of mind, contentment and life satisfaction.
                Instead of treating life like a graveyard of
                buried hopes, we should understand that
                hope motivates a person to achieve a desired
                outcome, to overcome hardships, to keep
                trying and to keep hoping despite the small
                odds of success. I no longer desire to be the
                hard-headed rationalist, tearing away the
                mask of illusion from people’s faces. Instead,
                I tend to agree with Christopher Reeves, the
                Hollywood actor, who became a quadriplegic
                after a riding accident and could only breathe
                through a ventilator, “Once you choose hope,
                anything’s possible.”

            <div class="coll2">
                At the turn of the century, people
                across the world had grand dreams of the
                future. From hover boards to flying cars and
                inter-galactic travel. However, the only thing
                that was certainly going to change was the
                calendar (chronos).
                Be it new year’s eve or other auspicious
                days, longing for, and honoring a special
                time (kairos) has been one of humanity’s
                most enduring endeavors. The idea
                that the gods of the sky could foretell
                the unpredictable ways of mother
                earth fascinated many early civilizations.
                Maybe it was the idea that these times,
                that brought prosperity (harvest) or wrath
                (winter) were times when God was somehow
                closer, and to an extent tangible.
                The ancient Greeks perceived this
                differently; they understood that not all
                time was equal. But also believed that the
                occurrence of a ‘special time’ was firmly
                in their hands. In Panathenaicus, Isocrates
                wrote, educated people are those, “who
                manage well the circumstances which they
                encounter day by day, and who possess
                a judgment which is accurate in meeting
                occasions as they arise and rarely misses the
                expedient course of action”.
                This realization of our control over
                the moments in our life that define our
                destiny opens our eyes to the value of every
                moment. A person falling sick, a death and an
                accident may all seem like moments of pure
                sadness and unpleasantness but are actually
                opportunities to reach out to grieving people
                forging stronger bonds with them; while a
                small seemingly insignificant action can lead
                to a forest fire or stoke a riot.
                Rest assured, the position of the sun
                in the sky or the aligning of five planets will
                never be responsible for any of the successes
                or failures faced in life. ‘Kairotic’ moments
                occur amidst a sea of ‘chronos’.But every
                moment has the potential to be a Kairos.
                Throughout the day, God hands each
                of us opportunities to be his instrument in
                other people’s lives. Seizing the moment
                and exploiting the opportunity at hand is
                the difference between a life of mediocrity
                and one of awesomeness. Often, we pray
                fervently for something and expect the
                ‘kairotic’ moment of deliverance to be a
                dramatic manifestation. Like the parting of
                the red sea. However, the reality is rarely that
                miraculous and can be logically explained.

            <div class="english-title">DADDA’S LITTLE GIRL</div>
            <div class="coll2">
                We were a perfect family of four until
                I realized that heaven had different plans for
                us. Be it weeks, months or years, the pain
                of losing my dad will pinch me for the rest
                of my life. Little did I know that he would
                never return home that day, that it was the
                last time I was seeing his face, that I would
                never have someone to get me my favourite
                candies anymore, that he would never see me
                become an engineer, and that I would never
                have my hero walk me down the aisle on my
                big day. It has been three months now. Life
                hasn’t been easy and feels like it never will.
                Nothing that people say makes sense right
                now. Sometimes, I wish I could turn back the
                clock just to hug him tight and never let go…
                I called him my ‘walrus-daddy’ cause
                of his huge built and soft heart. We shared a
                perfect father-daughter relationship, where I
                could pour my heart out to him without the
                fear of being judged. He was an obedient
                son, a loving husband and a wonderful father.
                Dadda didn’t tell me how to live life; he lived
                and let me watch him do it. I realized that
                any man could be a father but it takes a
                real man to be a ‘Dad’! Also, they say
                hard times help you push your limits
                and test your strength. I figured
                out how true that was when I
                was back to college the day
                just after I lost him. I gave
                my practical exam and
                headed back to school that evening to run
                the alumni race only to return home winning
                it. All I could do was look up to the heavens
                and smile, knowing that he was watching me.
                He carried me in his arms. Today, I carry him
                in my heart. I know this for real that no matter
                whose love gives me happiness, I’ll never find
                any like his. His memories will remain etched
                in my heart forever. I know he’s having a blast
                up there and I can’t wait to meet him again!
                Until then, those brisk winks and flying kisses
                to the sky will continue and I will live to make
                him smile.

            <div class="english-title">GIRL ON THE DESK</div>
            <div class="coll2">
                The roaring motorcycle engine
                shuddered to a halt as he pulled into one of
                Santacruz’s dimly lit bylanes. On a whim he
                decided to haunt the spot for a bit longer.
                He bought a Cornetto from the dusty old
                general store nearby and leaned against the
                bike, enjoying the state of isolation.
                Across the street was a photocopy
                booth, ‘ZEROX’ misspelt in bold across
                their banner. Their printer room, housing all
                the expensive machinery, had a light on to
                ward off deviant minds. Against this light, he
                perceived a silhouette, basking in the shaded
                comfort of the outer desk.
                Her face was illuminated by the lighter’s
                flame as she lit up a cigarette. She had a
                round but pretty face and wore a leather
                jacket over a red dress. In the familiarity
                of his surroundings, the stranger’s
                presence piqued his curiosity. “I
                must talk to this girl,” he thought.
                Disposing of the remains of
                his Cornetto, he walked
                up to her. “Where’d
                you get that smoke?” he
                asked, knowing, the only spot
                anyone could procure any sort of
                contraband at that ungodly hour was
                the lone chaiwala who usually parked a good
                kilometer away. “What?” she retorted, her
                voice soft and melodic even in her startled
                state. “The smoke. Where’d you get one
                around here?” he reiterated, with the most
                cringe-worthy grin he could summon. Her
                face stretched into an angelic smile as she
                pointed to the lane’s end. As he turned his
                head, his face fell with a single glance, having
                realized that the cursed chaiwala had picked
                that very corner as his base of operation that
                day. Shooting another grin, he walked away
                towards his malicious antagonist. He bought
                a single Marlboro and walked back to his bike.
                His yearning to communicate his curiosity
                was strong, but his courage had now failed
                him. He lifted his hand in salute as he lit up.
                She returned the gesture with another smile.
                Sweet mercies! She soon got done and began
                to walk to the other end without sparing him
                another look. It was the last time he ever saw
                her, as she turned at the corner, ‘the girl on
                the desk’. He’d dueled loss before, knowing
                all the usual emotions in its company, but in
                that moment he didn’t feel any of them, only
                a dull ache at the bottom of his chest. She
                could’ve been anyone, meant anything—a
                friend, an acquaintance, a fleeting muse,
                even “The One”. He had let his opportunity
                slip away, even with Lord Kairos smiling down
                from the heavens. Stubbing out death, he
                woke the roaring beast and rode back to the
                promise of warmth and comfort.
                Life is a winding road, with its ups and
                downs, sharp turns and sudden forks. Each
                path you see leads to an unknown destiny.
                This is why it is ruled by the choices you
                make. Opportunities aren’t always made to
                be grasped. Let some slip away like
                sand through your fingers. Although
                things are meant to end, they may also
                be a means to an end. Weigh each choice
                like you know your destination.

            <div class="english-title">IT’S THE LITTLE MOMENTS THAT COUNT!</div>
            <div class="coll2">
                When I first pondered upon moments in
                my life that fell in the ‘Kairos’ category, I came
                up short. If asked about their Kairos, others
                would probably recount some life-altering
                experiences. It was then that it occurred
                to me! What about the smaller moments in
                life? The ones that made a difference, but
                had been chalked up as everyday stuff. Like
                getting butterflies in my stomach when the
                guy I like smiles at me, or that feeling of
                triumph when I prove someone wrong. It’s
                that moment when inspiration struck and
                enabled me to put pencil to paper.
                Kairos means the right or opportune
                moment, derived from the Greek God of
                Opportunity, Caerus. Caerus, though said
                to be handsome, had absolutely no sense
                of style. According to legend, he had a long
                fringe in the front and was absolutely bald at
                the back. So our little Hermes-wannabe (yes,
                he had wings on his feet too) could easily be
                seized by the hair hanging over his face when
                he was arriving. But once he passed by, no
                one could grasp him. The back of his head
                being bald. This led to the phrase “seize the
                opportunity”.
                But not all of my ‘kairotic’ moments
                were of the ‘carpe diem’ variety. Some
                existed right in front of me. I just had to
                open my eyes to see and appreciate them.
                It’s those little moments that happened often
                but I hadn’t taken the time to notice.
                They were everyday moments like
                joking with friends on the hour-long walk
                home, or the pleasure I felt when someone
                complimented my sketch of the day. Also
                times like, when I managed that fluke headshot
                and the guys cheered like crazy, or
                when my code was finally bug-free (or so it
                seemed).
                It was these moments that made my
                life unique and if not for them I wouldn’t be
                where I am.
                What about you? Have you neglected these
                precious little moments in your life too? Dig
                Deep. Reminisce. Create some more!

            <div class="coll2">
                Lethargically walking up the slope
                to college, dreaming of what the day could
                possibly have in store for me, out of the blue,
                a little finger tugged at my hand. I turned
                around to a little girl saying, “Didi Didi! My
                mother wants to talk to you”. Shaken out of
                my reverie, I saw a weary eyed woman in a
                drab sari staring at me intently.
                “Could you please do me a favour?”
                she mumbled. Strange ideas ran through
                my mind, wondering what she could want
                from me. Just before I could refuse, she
                went on to say, “My daughter is giving
                her SSC boards this year. She will
                be the first educated girl in our
                family. A little guidance here
                and there will boost her to
                go ahead. I know you can do this. God will
                bless you!” I was taken aback. ‘Maa ki dua se
                Zindagi Jannat Se Kum Nahi Hoti … Jannat
                toh insaan ke naseeb mei hona ek alag hi
                ehasaas hai’, these lines once said by my aunt
                to somebody came to my mind.
                My mind started racing and I wondered
                if I’d be able to do justice to the faith she
                had in me. I had kept away from NSS and
                other social service programs as I barely had
                any time to spare and wanted to focus on
                my academics. Here, I was at a crossroads,
                deciding to help an unknown person with nil
                rewards, just 100 meters away from college.
                Nevertheless, I went ahead just for
                the kick of doing something different. It was
                an unusual experience— managing college,
                projects, assignments and teaching from
                scratch. Many thought I was being stupid in
                going out of my way to help somebody who
                didn’t have much scope. But the inner joy
                that it gave me was indescribable.
                To cut the long story short, weeks
                turned to months, and with a little extra
                coaching, she gave her Board Exams. I
                didn’t hear from her for three months after
                the exam. Coming out of college one day,
                after my dismal performance in my semester,
                apprehensive of the magnitude of drama
                awaiting me at home, I stopped in my tracks
                when I heard the familiar “Didi, Didi!” I was
                filled with nostalgia. I turned around to see
                my ebullient student, beaming with joy and
                offering me a box of sweets. The excitement
                in the
                Doe-shaped eyes said it all. I saw
                her mother standing at a distance, her
                eyes filled with pride. That was my
                ‘kairos’; it made me believe in my
                existence.

                “Offo! Do I need to change your diaper
                again?” my grandma stared, wide-eyed, at
                those beady black eyes as they stared back,
                empty.
                “All the time, like a baby! You should make
                some effort to get up too. I cannot lift you
                alone”, she said.
                “You keep quiet! I cannot get up if you keep
                talking”, he said.
                “This is what I get for helping”, she muttered.
                “I did not ask for your help”, he retorted.
                This was daily drama; like those running
                in old heritage theatres every day, without a
                slight change. The old couple would quarrel
                like children, one out of exhaustion and the
                other out of helplessness.
                With Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s
                combined, for Grandpa, life was like one
                of those nightmares in which the monster
                chases you, but neither can you escape nor
                call for help because you become paralyzed
                and mute at the same time. Getting up was
                like going for a test, a trip to the washroom
                was as tiring as mountain trekking, eating
                was a pain in the neckwith all those dietary
                restrictions, and bed was the only place of
                comfort and solace. In addition to all this, a
                physiotherapy session every Wednesday that
                felt like an approaching Monday.
                This is just a small glimpse of what
                the second infancy brought to grandpa. He
                would often recite catchy phrases from TV
                ads randomly, talk about incidents which
                never took place and sometimes
                even forget who we were. For most
                of the time, he would sit on his chair
                and gaze emptily into the space in front,
                where Grandma would appear from time to
                time to cater to him.
                I remember the day when Grandma
                fell ill and we took care of them. Grandpa’s
                day started as usual. He woke up, had his
                breakfast, spent the afternoon watching
                TV and blabbered trivial things at odd
                times; he was indifferent. But of course,
                he wasn’t to be blamed. It was the work of
                those witches inside his head, posing in the
                form of Alzheimer’s. Grandma on the other
                hand,kept worrying about him all day—“Did
                he get up? If he doesn’t wake up on time,
                he’ll get acidity”, “Take him to the loo or he’ll
                wet his pants”, “Feed him minced food, he
                cannot chew properly”.
                Later, by midnight we retired to bed.
                I was wide awake and unable to sleep. That
                was when I heard faint sounds of movement
                coming from Grandpa’s bedroom. I rushed to
                his room.
                There he was, awake and approaching
                Grandma’s side. He moved very slowly,
                inching forward with the help of his tripod stick
                that he’d diffidently use in front of everyone.
                I watched him silently as he sat beside her
                pillow, slowly and firmly. He laced his hand
                over her forehead and started humming a
                soft tune. I remained a silent spectator, like
                the bed and the mirror, invisible to him. It
                was inconceivable to imagine him get up
                on his own at such a stage, recalling the
                effort it took us to help him out of his chair
                every day. Those stern muscles just wouldn’t
                move, no matter how much he tried. That
                incredible night, I witnessed a feat of love—a
                tender, delectable moment that showed love
                triumphs over everything.

                I had tears in my eyes, laughing at a
                perverse comment made by my friend,along
                with my other vagabond friends who were
                chilling with me on the beach. I was sprawled
                like a starfish on the sand without caring
                about the fact that my mom would probably
                bite my head off for dirtying my new, washed
                jeans.
                We had to stop goofing around for
                some time, as a kid around 10 years old
                approached within hearing distance. That kid
                would’ve probably been scandalized as our
                talks needed PG(Parental Guidance). As we
                stared at him like he was an extraterrestrial
                being flying a UFO, he lost his concentration
                and stared back at us with curious cautious
                eyes forgetting about his kite that flew away.
                Disheartened, he stared at us and then back
                at his kite as it drifted away.
                My sweet friend chatted with him and
                took him to buy a kite. Looking at the two chat
                like long lost friends and walk away brought
                a smile to my face. Reminiscing my good old
                childhood days, I slipped away from a world
                of Techmax, software development projects
                and all the jazz that engineers keep thinking
                about, into a world of toe curling laughter
                watching Jerry beat Tom repeatedly,
                mischievous smiles after stealing candy
                from the fridge and a place where
                making something out of legos was
                an accomplishment. (Sighs)
                I was brought out of my stupor
                by the two desolate boys
                walking towards us with
                forlorn expressions. The kite seller had left
                for the day and now they were left without
                a kite. Seeing the kid in tears, we asked
                him what he would like to eat. He pointed
                towards the gola walla saying he’d love to
                have ‘chammach gola’. We went towards the
                gola walla and stood by his side, chatting as
                he prepared the gola for him.
                All this while, the kid looked at the
                gola like his prized possession, mesmerized
                by the way the crushed pieces of ice were
                put together to form his ‘chammach gola’.
                The sparkle in his eyes and the way he
                opened his mouth and then closed it, gaping
                at the glass in front of him that the maker
                of the masterpiece had set in front of him,
                was magical. The “thank you didi” that
                came from him didn’t reach my ears as I
                was dumbfounded wondering how a gola
                that cost 30 rupees could make someone so
                happy. A gola!
                Later that night when I was making a
                list of all the tasks for the next day, I wrote
                down the saying “Carpe Diem” at the end
                of the page. Seize the day! How ironic! I’m
                sure at some point everyone has written this
                phrase down, only to shred it into pieces by
                the end of the day, to vent some frustration
                of the entire day. The clock is ticking every
                second and the pressure cooker is whistling
                every time you make a wrong move telling
                you that you’re not going to like the end
                result. In the meantime, the mantra “Carpe
                Diem” feels like nothing but a sheer mockery
                of our robotic lives. We are running in this
                race of getting a 10 pointer semester after
                semester, doing internships, getting into
                the best companies and finally getting
                married, to do what? Finding that
                euphoric feeling that will be our own
                Kairotic moment? But will this race
                ever end?
                The happiness
                that shone in that kid’s
                eyes as bright as the
                Kohinoor, taught me a lesson.
                It’s not about the entire day; it is
                not just about having everything. It’s
                about making something worthwhile out of
                the little things you’ve done. It’s not about
                seizing the entire day but it is about seizing a
                few moments worth treasuring that will help
                you get through the entire day.
                So rather than Carpe Diem...
                Carpe a few Kairos every day!

                “It is not the strongest of the species that
                survive,
                Nor the most intelligent,
                But the one most responsive to change”
                —Charles Darwin
                Charles Darwin, Walt Disney, Isaac
                Newton, Thomas Edison, Albert Einstein and
                many other successful personalities faced a
                lot of criticism during their formative years.
                But those criticisms did not bring down
                their zeal or their thirst for success. It rather
                motivated them to prove their worth to
                the many critics around them, which is why
                they are remembered even today for their
                successful inventions.
                Why talk about the past? People
                today as well, are faced with a lot of
                criticisms. Be it a student who hasn’t been
                able to successfully get through a medical
                entrance and chooses something
                else instead of the medical stream, or
                even someone who hasn’t been able to
                achieve something is always talked about
                in the society. But setting all of this aside,
                what is more important is that the individual
                who at first had given up due to his failures,
                now decides to sit back, think, ponder and
                get set for a new adventure that is still yet
                to come. The ultimate decision for taking
                that one step towards a new future rests
                only on that one individual. One has to really
                think about the new road that has suddenly
                appeared and how one can make it the best.
                One needs to collect one’s thoughts and get
                ready to move onto something that involves
                change, something that involves transition—
                from old thoughts to something completely
                new. No matter what obstacles life has given
                him in the past, the individual who is on this
                new journey needs to forget the past, learn
                from it and step ahead with conviction, but
                this time with more enthusiasm.
                Considering the new path now! When
                one decides to move on with the new way
                that has opened up, there comes a time
                when one is half way through to achieve that
                new goal. At that time, when the individual
                puts on his thinking cap to really compare
                situations of the past and the present,
                the individual realizes that this path has
                really brought something good, this path
                was something that was destined, this was
                something really planned to happen in his
                life. Now this individual is quite content with
                what he has achieved till date. No matter
                how far an individual moves on or how much
                he achieves in life, there is always that one
                moment when he looks back to wonder why
                whatever happened led him to taking a new
                step.
                This is what you call, “Living a Kairos
                Life in a Chronos world.” We should always
                live our days looking for those moments,
                those inexplicable times when God’s will
                and his ways intersect our daily walks of life.
                And trust me, this could happen anytime!
                A friend could call you out of the blue and
                give you a good word or a colleague could
                take a moment aside and lend you a hand.
                God is always surprising us with His perfect,
                kairos time. But are we willing to embrace
                the occasion?

            <div class="english-title">NEW YEAR RESOLUTION</div>
            <div class="coll2">
                Days, weeks, months and years go by;
                time is flying. Every year, we think, plan and
                make resolutions for the coming year for it to
                be great, memorable, full of joy and so that it
                fulfills our dreams. However, everyone feels
                the need to limit these resolutions to their
                feasibility and completeness. Resolutions can
                be as small as ‘throwing wrappers/plastics in
                dustbins’, ’restricting ourselves from spitting
                on the road’, ‘avoiding the use of abusive
                language’, ‘following traffic rules’, etc.
                Positive attitude and energy is what
                we need to give more emphasis to. We need
                to nurture the good qualities required in an
                individual. The same is nicely described by
                the famous Marathi writer P. K. Atre in this
                stanza:
                “ Deh devaache mandir jashi usaat ho
                saakhar tasa dehat Parmeshwar”
                God resides in every individual; to
                elaborate this, he has given us an
                example of sugarcane from which
                sugar is extracted. The Lord resides
                in every person with some good
                qualities. Godliness can be
                shown to the society by carrying out initiatives
                for certain social causes which help the poor and
                downtrodden.
                Another very important aspect which
                we should be aware of is that we should never
                be egoistic. One should be proud of what he has
                achieved but should not be flattered by it. One
                can achieve laurels in his life but he still needs to
                be simple. Again, let me take the help of a famous
                line from the Abhanga:
                “ Maati bole kumbhaaraala ka paayee tudavishi,
                tuzaach aahe shevat vedya maazhya paayashi”
                However big an individual might become,
                he has to realize that he has been raised from
                soil and will ultimately return to the same soil.
                Whatever your achievements, the destination
                of every life is death. We are sent to the earth for
                some specific tasks and we need to strive to attain
                them. It is not you but your works which will
                last forever. For youngsters, it is very necessary
                to show perseverance and diligence to achieve
                the goals set for them in the fields of education,
                technology, sports, culture, etc. The line by a
                Gyanpeeth award winning Marathi writer says
                everything about it:
                “Vaasantik mand pavnaane aandolit zhaalelyaa
                mandaar manjirichyaa bhovati
                madhugunjarava
                karnaarya milindapramanemaanasachi
                manovrutti asaavi”
                One needs to be focused like a honeybee
                and always be in search of something that will
                add value to one’s career. If we stick to the basics
                and follow our resolutions for the year, they

                It was a Sunday evening and one of our
                routinely visits to the Siddhivinayak temple.
                My family and I had just joined the incredibly
                long queue that snaked its way into the
                temple’s sanctum. The line grew steadily as
                we paced forward, inch by inch, restlessly,
                hoping we’d make it quick till the entrance.
                The temple’s compound held numerous stalls,
                all of them selling laddus and other sweets,
                garlands and other merchandise. We bought
                a garland and a plate of ‘offerings’ at one of
                the stalls before entering the line.
                A while later and deeper into the
                queue, I noticed a thin, young girl holding
                a basket of garlands coming towards the
                queue. She wore a ragged frock of fading
                pink. She approached random people in the
                crowd to sell garlands, but most of us had
                one and would turn down her offer. I watched
                her as she hopped over the red tiles, carefully
                avoiding the yellow ones as they alternately
                dressed the floor. Her foot stopped beside
                mine.
                “Didi, mala Bhagwaan ke liye”, she
                showed me her basket of garlands. I politely
                refused.
                “Ok didi, nexsht time!” she winked
                and turned away, proceeding further, into the
                black of the night. Would the girl hop the red
                tiles the same way selling her garlands years
                later? I wondered.
                Children are so blissfully ignorant.
                Having stepped into adulthood, all of us
                begin looking at life through different colored
                glasses—sometimes red and frustrated,
                sometimes blue and somber, yellow
                and bright or grey and dull. Time
                isn’t playtime anymore. Not all men are
                good uncles or women good aunties. We
                finally come to realize and understand the
                world. Our shoulders become heavy with
                responsibilities as we blend ourselves into the
                mundaneness of work life. We work to earn,
                earn to live. We work and work, and eagerly
                anticipate the weekend holidays. And once
                they’re spent, wait a long way until the next.
                We forget to cherish life as we live. Life’s no
                longer a wonderland, and reality tugs at our
                shoulders.
                Yet, it isn’t a bad idea to get blissfully
                ignorant once in a while and dance our way
                through wonderland, carefully hopping over
                just the red tiles, leaving the yellows...Nay?

                I was left without a clue<br/>
                Didn’t know the next thing left to do<br/>
                Staring blankly at the cloudy sky<br/>
                I didn’t think we’d ever say goodbye<br/>
                I just came here to meet you<br/>
                Can’t hold my tears anymore<br/>
                You swore you would always stay<br/>
                You said that you’d never go away<br/>
                I think of our time together<br/>
                And for a minute I do feel better<br/>
                But then it comes pouring back in<br/>
                Gripping my throat, I can’t breathe<br/>
                All the promises you never kept<br/>
                I’m left alone standing at your grave<br/>
                I’m broken in two, do you even know?<br/>
                Oh tell me, did you really have to go?<br/>
                Just then my tears hit the gravestone<br/>
                And I look down at the roses I left you<br/>
                They’re still fresh and beaming red<br/>
                Scarcely haunted by the dead<br/>
                It felt as if they’re looking at me<br/>
                As if they’re smiling, smiling lovingly<br/>
                That’s when it struck me<br/>
                And that was the moment I knew<br/>
                You’re gone but you’re not really gone<br/>
                Maybe in a better place but never far<br/>
                You’re right there watching over me<br/>
                I know you’re smiling, smiling lovingly<br/>
                And that moment was enough to keep me going on<br/>

                It all starts like a flash in my mind<br/>
                Out of nowhere my mind does suddenly find<br/>
                An idea to express this time<br/>
                And make it more gripping with some words to rhyme<br/>

                Slowly and gradually it becomes long<br/>
                The words moving to places where they belong<br/>
                Sometimes the words come rather slow<br/>
                While sometimes they are in full flow<br/>
                After some challenging brainstorming sessions<br/>
                I finally arrive at a line of conclusion<br/>
                What started out as an idea in my mind<br/>
                Now is a full bunch of words to bind<br/>
