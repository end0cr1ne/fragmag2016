                    Before we delve into the enthralling writings this

                    call to mind all your contributions to this burgeoning

                <div>We live in a world where every second of what we do with the time
                    bestowed upon us counts. Every opportunity that we seize leads us on a
                    new journey, a new path in life. It is these moments, these opportunities
                    that define us.
                    Our theme has been prudently chosen to reflect on the moments
                    where we fail to seize the opportunities as we are tangled in our so called
                    hectic life. In a constant attempt to secure our future which is nothing
                    but a mere probability, we fail to realize the only control that lies with
                    us is that of the existing moment. We can either make a decision and
                    take the opportunity fearlessly or spend our entire lives regretting it.
                    After a lot of contemplation, discourse and over 1000 whatsapp
                    messages, given the present day scenario, the team finally unanimously
                    agreed upon the theme - ‘Kairos’. Kairos are those moments in our lives
                    which are not mere numbers that define time but it is what we make of that
                    time.
                    Being a part of the editorial board has indeed been a kairotic journey
                    for the entire team! Selecting the editorial board, conducting the meetings
                    (playing the role of a peacemaker at every meeting), encouraging budding
                    writers to showcase their skills and compiling the entire magazine has been
                    a learning experience.
                    It has been a momentous ride, working with a colorful kaleidoscope
                    of personalities. In spite of the posts assigned to them the entire team has
                    worked in every other department. The entire process of reading, editing
                    and putting together the amazing contributions of the students of this
                    college has been a wonderful opportunity and an insightful journey.
                    It would be inexcusable if I forget to extend my appreciation to the
                    people who were our support throughout this entire journey - our professors.
                    On behalf of the entire editorial board, I extend my heartfelt gratitude
                    to Prachi Ma’am, Garima Ma’am, Saurabh Sir and Tisha Ma’am who have
                    supported us unconditionally. I sincerely thank our cultural Incharge- Dr.
                    V. Bilolikar and our Principal, Dr. Srija Unnikrishnan who in spite of their
                    busy schedule have helped and assisted us. Lastly, I am grateful to all our
                    contributors for the enriching articles, beautiful photographs, mesmerizing
                    poems and captivating sketches.
                    As the time and space provided does not permit me to write any
                    further, I hope that this magazine meets all expectations and takes everyone
                    who reads this on a beautiful kairotic journey.
                    Happy reading, folks!

                <div>It is quite heartening to note that this year
                    the CRCE has decided upon the theme:
                    “KAIROS”. I am sure it has taken long
                    pondering deliberations to arrive at such
                    a unique and potent theme. I am indeed
                    pleased to note and infer at what the inherent
                    meaning the staff and students of CRCE
                    would like to draw from such a theme, if not
                    to convert opportunities into paradigms. The
                    single-word theme ‘Kairos’ has the widest of
                    ramifications, which, if properly understood,
                    directed and harnessed will achieve excellent
                    academic and human progress in the life of
                    the CRCE community and that
                    of humanity at large.
                    ‘Kairos’ in the present context:
                    It is common knowledge that
                    ‘Kairos’ is an ancient Greek word
                    meaning the right or opportune
                    moment, in contrast to another
                    Greek word ‘Chronos’, which is
                    sequential time. While ‘chronos
                    is quantitative minutes, ‘kairos’
                    is qualitative moments.
                    But ‘Kairos’ calls for deeper understanding
                    in all its diverse perceptions and possibilities.
                    It is being able to recognize timeliness,
                    appropriateness and propriety of the given
                    situation. It also implies being knowledgeable
                    and involved in the given environment and
                    thus being able to seize the opportune
                    moment.
                    ‘Kairos’ is a potent moment or time full of possibilities. When faced with it, depending
                    on how one handles, it can either make or
                    mar one’s dreams. Kairos can be a moment
                    of destiny, a moment of fulfillment. It is a
                    moment of reckoning and implies risk. It is a
                    pregnant time. While time and tide move by
                    chronos, kairos comes in by divine plan and
                    intervention. It is a leap time, a momentous
                    moment in the normal chronos time. It results
                    into new paradigms.
                    ‘Time’ and ‘Opportunity’ are so linked to each
                    other that they are like two sides of the same
                    coin. When ‘opportunity’ meets
                    ‘time’ we have an amazing
                    result. This intersection of
                    time and opportunity is what
                    we call a ‘kairos moment’. But
                    there is a risk factor here. One
                    needs courage to take that
                    risk because it is a moment
                    of reckoning. It is a moment
                    or opportunity which is
                    unrepeatable, irresistible and
                    unique making a lasting impact
                    on our lives.
                    ‘Kairos’ from a Biblical perspective:
                    It is the ‘appointed time’ in the purpose of
                    God, when God acts. It is a crucial time, a
                    right time, a God-ordained time or sacred
                    time. ‘Kairos’ is God’s dimension, not marked
                    by past, present or future.
                    God is the author of the Universe. He ordered
                    the universe in time and space. Therefore, God is not subject to chronos, but He is
                    above it. When Jesus came it was a cosmic
                    collision of the sacred and the secular. The
                    ‘divine kairos’ pierced its way into creation
                    at the right time. Thus, with incarnation of
                    the divine word, i.e. Jesus, God entered into
                    history, in the person of Jesus Christ. By this
                    we are able to get a glimpse of the so-called
                    other side, i.e. eternity, and to know and
                    understand how God works on his kairos.
                    Through Jesus we are linked to the divine
                    moments, which we can call God’s moments,
                    God’s time, fulfilled time or prime time.
                    ‘Kairos’ moments in History:
                    We have numerous Kairos moments down
                    the ages. It is worth mentioning a few here.
                    a) Talking of the birth of Jesus Christ, we
                    say that He entered history at the ‘appointed
                    time’, when the Roman dominions were at
                    their highest and the unity of the empire was
                    assured under Augustus Caesar. Hence, it
                    was the most appropriate time for Jesus to
                    enter into history.
                    b) We have the Barbarians in the
                    4th and 5th centuries attacking the Roman
                    Empire with all barbarism, but finally being
                    overpowered by the evangelizing and
                    civilizing power of the Church, led by Pope
                    St. Gregory the Great.
                    c) When Napoleon Bonaparte invaded
                    Russia, it was the most inopportune moment
                    for Napoleon as the Russian weather was
                    at its worst, and opportunely, the Russians
                    expected with bated breath for such an
                    invasion at their favourable kairos moment.
                    The result was a disaster for Napolean and
                    Kairos victory for the Russians. History
                    did repeat itself again with Hitler when he
                    invaded Russia.
                    d) When Indira Gandhi, in the 1971
                    Bangla Desh Liberation war decided to send
                    Indian armed forces to the then East Pakistan,
                    the American President at that time called her
                    a ‘bitch’ and threatened her with sanctions.
                    Undeterred, she went ahead with her timely
                    decision and the result was the creation of a
                    new nation –“Bangladesh”.
                    e) When St. John Paul II, (Polish Pope
                    Karol Woyjtila) was elected Pope it was
                    considered by the world as ominous, because
                    he was the first non-Italian Pope after fivehundred
                    years. And then there came the fall
                    of Communism in Russia and its communist
                    conglomerates.
                    f)When the world leaders are grappling
                    with pollution and destruction of environment,
                    and the death of our beautiful planet Earth,
                    Pope Francis seizes the opportune moment
                    and comes out with his famous encyclical
                    ‘Laudato Si’, the first Pope ever to address such an environment issue. His election too
                    is considered ominous.
                    g) And our own Indian Independence
                    is a case history of Kairos, when the unity
                    of Indian states of diverse cultures and
                    languages was considered ready to take
                    over the power from the British for self-rule.
                    History therefore has much light to shed on
                    the Kairos times, moments and opportunities
                    in the events down the ages.
                    ‘Kairos’ of the Academic pursuits:
                    From various perspectives as enunciated
                    above, what would kairos hold for students
                    pursuing their academic degrees? Needless
                    to say that the Kairos moments are the most
                    transforming milestones in a student’s life.
                    The Sophist Isocrates writes that educated
                    people are those- “who manage well the
                    circumstances which they encounter day by
                    day, and who possess a judgment which is
                    accurate in meeting occasions as they arise
                    and rarely misses the expedient course of
                    action”.
                    Students have ample Kairos moments,
                    opportunities and possibilities. One needs
                    to sense with one’s sixth sense to fathom
                    these and to make timely decisions and
                    options. We need to view ‘time’ not in terms
                    of ‘seconds’ which tick by, but in terms of
                    ‘opportunities’ flying by. And this requires a
                    mental shift. A kairos student is one whose
                    senses are attuned to the slightest hint of
                    an opportunity and has the courage to leap
                    upon them with all his/her might.
                    The world is dense with opportunities.
                    Growth and maturity is the end result when
                    students are sensitive to recognize these
                    opportune moments and act on them. The
                    CRCE provides the best of environment
                    to decipher these kairos moments. The
                    students need to look beyond their minds’
                    horizon and look for kairos opportunities
                    that will bring new shifts in their paradigms.
                    In Conclusion we say, that in their pursuit of
                    engineering degrees the students are called
                    upon to make timely time-to-time decisions.
                    Such decisions could be momentous and
                    portentous and make a life-long impact on
                    their careers. Moving merely by chronos
                    time one may be dragging in life. Risking
                    for kairos moments is a must. There is
                    true dynamism there. The end result will
                    be a fully fit, independent, matured and
                    decisive personality ready to take on every
                    opportunity that comes by. Remember that
                    these kairos moments, opportunities, risks
                    are unique, unrepeatable and decisive.

                <div>I am extremely happy to know that
                    the students of CRCE are publishing a
                    souvenir named “Fragmag” during the
                    current academic year 2015-16. Fragmag
                    is a great opportunity to showcase the
                    numerous talents of the students. It is
                    also a platform for our students to hone
                    their literary, technological and mythical
                    skills.
                    Kairos meaning opportunity
                    or season or fitting time is
                    an apt theme for the annual
                    magazine of the college.
                    Every student of CRCE
                    begins his or her Kairos once
                    he or she is enrolled in the
                    College. The entire itinerary
                    of four years is a period of KAIROS for
                    each and every student. It is the period
                    during which students make strenuous
                    efforts to get equipped themselves
                    with technical knowledge and infinite
                    information. By excelling in various
                    curricular and extracurricular activities
                    students bring laurels and glory to the
                    Institution.
                    During the time of KAIROS, the
                    opportunities and avenues galore
                    .Sometime the opportunities that
                    our Time presents us with, are the
                    opportunities that are made by our
                    proactivity. Sometimes the opportunities
                    are the chances to invest slowly in some
                    project that we are working on. But in
                    any case, every student
                    must reach the pinnacle
                    of Kairos during his/her
                    journey on the corridors of
                    the Institution come what
                    may.
                    I take this occasion to wish
                    each and every student of
                    CRCE best of luck as he
                    or she treads the path of kairos. Let us
                    hope that the chronos moments of all
                    the Students are transformed into kairos
                    moments in the years to come. I also
                    hope and pray that the faculty of CRCE
                    may enable the fraternity of students to
                    reach the highest pedestal of Kairos in
                    their lives.

                <div>Friends, in the Bible it is said, Jesus
                    begins his ministry by saying “The time is
                    fulfilled…” the Greek word for time used
                    here is Kairos and not Chronos. Chronos
                    speaks about the time in the past as in
                    chronology while Kairos is the moment
                    of exhilaration. I am sure when we all
                    look back in time we will surely find our
                    moments of kairos that have
                    made us the persons we are
                    today.
                    One such moment in my
                    life has been the decision
                    of my superiors to send me
                    to Fr. Agnel Ashram. Initially
                    when I was consulted I was
                    a little hesitant because I
                    had never before worked in such a large
                    education complex. I’ve been around
                    the country ministering in small far-flung
                    parishes of the Great Nicobar, being
                    closer to Indonesia than mainland India,
                    remote parts of Jharkhand and Kolkata.
                    I was skeptical whether I would ever
                    fit in and yet I did not want to miss my
                    Kairos moment and that has made all
                    the difference.
                    Traversing the length, breadth and height
                    of a little more than the three acre plot,
                    interacting with the heads of institutes,
                    heads of departments, experiencing the
                    love of students / children from KG to
                    PG and today even PhD, in their warm
                    handshakes, have been my most exciting
                    moments. Visits to the various labs,
                    workshops, be they of the
                    school, ITI, Trade School,
                    Polytechnic or Community
                    Polytechnic and Degree,
                    for me have been moments
                    of great learning. The
                    vibrant faith expressed by
                    countless persons in their
                    devotion to Venerable Fr.
                    Agnelo, lovingly called Agnel Baba has
                    enhanced my own spirituality and made
                    me more humble. From a Rustic I have
                    journeyed towards refinement, this was
                    made possible because of the countless
                    persons I encountered at the Ashram.
                    Every single moment has been a kairos
                    and not just moments of Chronos. May
                    we be blessed with the wisdom to
                    decipher the Kairos in the Chronos.

                <div>In Greek mythology, Kairos, the youngest child
                    of Zeus, was the god of opportunity. Thus the
                    ancient Greek word ‘KAIROS’ refers to the right
                    or opportune or defining moment. There are
                    KAIROS moments in the life of every person
                    that have influenced him/her strongly and to a
                    large extent determine what he/she is today.
                    Collectively, there are such periods or times in
                    the history of communities, countries and world
                    at large.
                    If one looks at the growth of civilization from
                    a technological perspective,
                    there are several significant
                    moments which shaped our
                    life styles. For the early man,
                    discovery of the ‘wheel’ was a
                    defining moment. More recently,
                    the Industrial revolution was a
                    game changer. Use of technology
                    aimed at reducing human labour
                    revolutionized manufacturing and
                    large industrial establishments
                    came up throughout Europe. Soon the change
                    spread across the world. Innovations which
                    started with Industrial Revolution gathered
                    momentum over the years and still continue.
                    Edison, Graham Bell and Wright brothers
                    are some of the inventors of 19th Century
                    and early 20th century who made path
                    breaking inventions which laid foundations
                    for subsequent transformations. Second half
                    of the 20th century saw computers stretching
                    human capabilities like never before and man
                    landing on Moon. Mars does not look far away
                    now. Internet and mobiles have opened up
                    the digital world for us- a world of unending
                    opportunities.
                    Kairos moments are outcome of human
                    ingenuity and painstaking efforts. It is about
                    challenging conventions and the way we
                    are taught to do things. It is not that efforts
                    always yield expected results. You need to be
                    willing to face setbacks and remain positive
                    in mind. Edison once said, “I have not failed.
                    I’ve just found 10000 ways that won’t work”.
                    True, ‘one percent inspiration and 99 per cent
                    perspiration’- that is what success is all about.
                    I am sanguine that India is in the cusp of great
                    changes backed by technological
                    innovations. Great prospects await
                    our youth today. India is already
                    a recognized leader in services
                    sector. ’Make in India’ initiative
                    could see the manufacturing
                    sector getting a boost. Digital
                    India is another initiative aimed
                    at simplifying governance so
                    that public interaction with the
                    Government becomes a lot easier
                    and transparent. Besides creating jobs, all these
                    initiatives will provide the right environment for
                    a transformed India where all citizens can grow
                    to their full potential. We can look forward to
                    a number of Kairos moments for Indians in the
                    coming days.
                    I am sure our students will benefit from the
                    evolving opportunities mentioned above. But,
                    one initiative I wish some of our students pursue
                    is the ‘Start Up India’ initiative flagged off by our
                    Prime Minister recently. It gives opportunity to
                    create your own Kairos Moments.
                    Let me conclude by quoting the theme of an
                    earlier edition of FRAGMAG: “ Carpe Diem”-

                <div><p>After umpteen brainstorming sessions and hours of deliberation, hoping to get our minds fixated
                    on ‘the perfect’ theme for Fragmag 2016, we finally zeroed in on this beautiful word—‘Kairos’.</p>

                    <p>‘Kairos’ is a Greek word denoting ‘the right or opportune moment’. According to ancient Greek
                        mythology, Kairos, the youngest son of Zeus, was also the Greek god of opportunity. He was
                        lithe,
                        swift on his feet and had a characteristic tuft of hair across his forehead. He could be seized
                        by
                        his
                        forelock as he approached, but once he raced ahead, it was impossible to get hold of him, the
                        rest
                        of his head being completely bald. He therefore served as a paradigm for—‘Seize the
                        opportunity’,
                        reminding us to make the most of the chances that come our way, most of the time,
                        unanticipated.</p>

                    <p><i>“There are moments which mark your life.
                        Moments when you realize nothing will ever be the same,
                        And time is divided into two parts – before this, and after this.”</i>
                        —John Hobbes</p>
                    Kairos is the time of expectation and excitement; it is an indefinite window of opportunity, also
                    called ‘God’s time’, which lasts for a few fugacious moments, but leaves an ingrained impression
                    on one’s life. For some, it may be the time they turned the corner to succeed in their endeavors,
                    for some, an epiphany that changed their lives, while for most others, the time when they clasped
                    promising opportunities.
                    All of us have experienced certain kairotic moments that have been
                    etched into our memories, making it possible for us to relate to the theme
                    and interpret it in our own way. The Editorial Board thus believed that
                    ‘Kairos’ was a befitting theme for this year’s edition. The overwhelming
                    response we have received from everyone has only ascertained our belief.
                    We hold extreme pride in being called the English
                    Editors of our precious college magazine and being a part
                    of the Editorial Board—a coalescence of
                    creativity, talent and zeal. We are highly
                    impressed seeing the diversity in the topics
                    people touched on for this particular theme,
                    right from philanthropy and feminism
                    to politics; many have also shared their
                    personal experiences that brought
                    smiles to our faces. Working on
                    their writings has been an incredible
                    experience, and taking a peek into
                    everyone’s minds has been
                    wonderful. None of this would
                    have been possible without
                    the constant encouragement
                    and wholehearted support of

                    enjoy reading the
                    magazine as much as
                    we enjoyed

                <div class="english-title">THE RIGHT MOMENT</div>
                <div>When the theme of Fragmag
                    2016—“Kairos”, was first introduced to
                    everyone, it really intrigued me, having heard
                    this word before but not knowing what it
                    really meant. I went back home and after
                    researching a lot about it, came across this: “A
                    moment in time or a timeframe in which God
                    makes it possible for something of lasting
                    importance or significance to happen”.
                    Sometimes the word kairos is
                    translated colloquially as “God’s timing”.
                    And I suddenly realized that although the
                    word may be unfamiliar to me, the concept
                    predominantly existed in our lives. Now let
                    me first narrate a simple story.
                    Once upon a time when the kings
                    ruled our country, in one such kingdom, a
                    couple was blessed with twin boys. They were
                    raised with a lot of love and affection, and
                    eventually grew up to be fine and talented
                    young men. It was now time for them to step
                    out of their house and start earning a living.
                    Both the brothers had a knack for trading,
                    and hence joined an established trader as his
                    apprentices. One fine day, the trader wanted
                    either of the brothers to travel to another
                    kingdom far away and sell cotton. Knowing
                    that cotton was not an expensive commodity
                    and that it would only fetch them negligible
                    profits, the first brother refused. The second
                    brother however, agreed and started out on
                    his journey the very next day. The second
                    brother successfully completed the work
                    assigned to him and on his return, both the
                    brothers got married.
                    A few months later, both the brothers
                    were offered to travel and sell ivory. This time,
                    the first brother enthusiastically accepted
                    the offer, but suddenly his wife fell
                    severely ill and was on her deathbed,
                    and so the assignment landed on the
                    second brother’s shoulders yet again.
                    The third time, the trader wanted
                    one of the brothers to travel and sell rubies,
                    emeralds and gold. Since the commodities
                    were valuable, he wanted to confer it to
                    someone trustworthy. Having proven his
                    worth twice to the trader, the second
                    brother was chosen this time. By then, the
                    second brother with his skills had established
                    enough trading relationships. On returning
                    from the third assignment, he resigned from
                    his apprenticeship and went on to set up his
                    own flourishing business. The first brother
                    however, remained an assistant forever.
                    Looking at the above story, many
                    of you may feel that circumstances did not
                    favour the poor first brother. But haven’t
                    circumstances always favoured the ones who
                    make the best of them? In life, our innermost
                    sensibility always urges us to wait. We wait,
                    out of greed, for better opportunities. We
                    wait, out of ego, to make peace with a loved
                    one, or to tell someone that we love them.
                    We wait, out of fear, to speak up against
                    injustice, hoping it will subside eventually. We
                    wait, always for the right moment, for God’s
                    timing. The harsh truth is that, distances will
                    only grow, injustice will only rise. We forget
                    that our biggest opportunity to do something
                    right is now.
                    Our Kairos is NOW.

                <div>Dearest Laxmi,<br/>
                    I am an indigent woman who was
                    only capable of giving you life, and my
                    reminiscences through this letter. I can
                    apprehend your abhorrence of the term
                    mother, which I certainly do not deserve to
                    be called after having abandoned you on the
                    doorsteps of your orphanage. However, with
                    the anticipation that my words will somehow
                    recuperate our relationship established and
                    broken by your umbilical cord, I write to you
                    the first and the last letter of my life.
                    I was the consequence of one of
                    the many unreported gang rapes on a
                    dispossessed woman, who was awarded
                    insanity for her incessant efforts of trying
                    to file a police complaint. As I grew walking
                    naked on the streets of Mumbai, I witnessed
                    my mother’s resolve disintegrate to lunacy.
                    One such day while she was murmuring
                    curses, tearing her tangled hair, draped in
                    a disheveled sari, she barked at a distant
                    man who carried away her daughter, but
                    did nothing to impede the kidnapping. I
                    was touched, molested and penetrated.
                    But fed, clothed and sheltered. Eventually
                    I learnt that the punishment of escape was
                    not worth the freedom. It was easier to have
                    been compensated for discordant sex, than
                    to have sought justice for it, in India. With
                    that comprehension I deliberated on an
                    occupation for my diurnal idleness. I would
                    travel in the Mumbai locals, from Churchgate
                    to Virar and back. In search for an exultant
                    and peaceful woman, in whose skin I
                    could imagine myself every night while
                    satiating the carnal needs of my client.
                    The agony of that excruciating activity
                    was subdued as I floated in my
                    imagination, somewhat like my
                    own alternative reality. Dressed
                    in civilized clothes, I would
                    ceaselessly hunt for my
                    muse, follow her,
                    investigate, try to initiate a conversation, and
                    sincerely hope that she would illustrate what
                    being happy felt like. With the commencement
                    of my quest, I was first deceived by the smiles
                    of Gauri, snuggling her infant in her sari like
                    he weighed nothing, while she advertised
                    her collection of cheap bangles and earrings.
                    For many nights I smiled like her in my
                    imaginary parallel universe until I gathered
                    some courage to talk to her. She was traded
                    (she refuses to call it marriage) by her father
                    for a sum of Rs. 2500 to a chronic alcoholic
                    who survived on her income and her body.
                    Unlike me she had learnt to paste a grin on
                    her scarred face for the sake of her children.
                    Regardless of my heartbreak, I recommenced
                    my chase. And in that expedition encountered
                    scores of Goddesses like Gauri existing in
                    their nonexistent lives. Saraswati, commuting
                    daily to drop her son to school, was a middleclass
                    housewife serving her husband and inlaws,
                    in spite of their tormenting taunts, for
                    the insubstantial dowry that she brought into
                    the marriage. An unwanted daughter and a
                    burden on her family, she was literate but
                    not educated, because her parents believed
                    that cooking and child-rearing were the only
                    skills she needed. Nevertheless her laughter
                    was capable of concealing years of neglect. I
                    also met Durga, a fearless female constable
                    whose valiance I aspired. I saw her detain
                    thieves and thrash eve-teasers outside
                    Bandra station, but it never crossed my mind
                    that her gallantry came with a cost. Her
                    working hours deteriorated her family life
                    and as it was almost impossible to ascend the
                    career ladder as a woman police officer, she
                    deliberated resigning. Then I met Sita and
                    Radhika, both were aspiring doctors. They
                    were by far the most cheerful girls I had met.
                    Sita committed suicide that August, after she
                    failed to clear her AIPMT exams for the
                    second time. But Radhika believed it was
                    also because she was body-shamed
                    for a long time by the boy she had a
                    crush on. It’s incomprehensible
                    how women hold such
                    trivialities in high regard.
                    Fortunately all prostitutes
                    skinny or otherwise earned equal
                    business. Anyway, Radhika remained
                    the inspiration of my imagination for
                    the longest period of time. She was a bold,
                    beautiful, well-educated and mature girl,
                    who had a wealthy, loving family and a lover
                    who respected her. She only ceased to be my
                    muse when she told me she had stage two
                    breast cancer. This was around the same time
                    I discovered I was pregnant. I was devastated
                    by both, the knowledge of my pregnancy
                    and the realization that for an Indian woman,
                    there is no alternative reality. She just has one
                    reality and that is the universe she is born in.
                    And my love, the universe you were going
                    to be born in would kill your soul before it
                    would liberate your body. The orphanage is
                    your parting gift. A door to a different, if not
                    a better life.
                    Laxmi, I also want you to know
                    that I never contemplated an abortion
                    because those nine months were the most
                    enlightening days of my life. In India we are
                    taught to worship our Goddesses for their
                    angelic beauty, fertility, fidelity, compassion,
                    and unrelenting capacity to love and sacrifice.
                    Be it my mother, who lives an anonymous
                    life of a lunatic or a glamorous model,
                    who dies of drug abuse, we as women are
                    expected to meet numerous unrealistic and
                    impractical anticipations of other women,
                    men and society as a whole. We are named
                    as Goddesses, expected to behave like one,
                    but seldom treated like one. However, your
                    perspective will decide whether you curse a
                    mountain for being an obstacle, stare at its
                    stark magnificence, or climb it. I chose to
                    stare. You can climb it. People will envy you,
                    hate you, outcast you, chastise you, but they
                    cannot pull you down if you don’t let them.
                    Your birth reminds me of a concept introduced
                    to me by Radhika; “Kairos”. It is the moment
                    when everything happens. People let
                    time and circumstances define their
                    Kairos. But the day you gather courage
                    to define your ‘everything’, you will be
                    everything. I have not named you after
                    the Goddess of wealth, but after the queen
                    of Jhansi. I want you, not to believe in an
                    alternate reality, but to alter your reality.<br/>
                    Happy 16th birthday.<br/>
                    Love,<br/>
                    Sati.

                <div class="english-title">THE THIRD</div>
                <div>It was a cold December morning. I was
                    on my way to my aunt’s place in Churchgate.
                    It was the end of my fifth semester and I
                    was ecstatic about spending my Christmas
                    vacation with my cousins. We get along like
                    a house on fire! I packed my belongings and
                    boarded an early morning local to Churchgate
                    from Mira Road. Earphones plugged in,
                    listening to my favourite FM channel, all I
                    could think of was the fun that awaited me.
                    It had been a year since I last met them, and
                    I was really looking forward to this trip. As
                    the train halted at Dahisar, a young woman
                    boarded the train. She was amazingly welldressed;
                    with her perfectly draped sari and
                    matching jewelry she looked beautiful. It took
                    me a while to realize that she was a transgender.
                    I saw her walking towards me. I knew
                    she would ask for money like they usually did,
                    so I pretended to be asleep. She came and
                    sat right beside me and I heard a shrill voice
                    say, “Don’t worry, I won’t beg from you”. I
                    was surprised. I slowly opened my eyes and
                    looked at her. She smiled, I smirked in return.
                    “Where are you heading to?”, she asked me
                    after a while.
                    “Churchgate”, I replied. “What about you?”
                    “Same! I have an interview there.”
                    As soon as I heard this, I couldn’t resist but
                    ask,”Interview?”
                    She nodded in agreement. I could see
                    the excitement in her eyes. She began to tell
                    me her story. Then began the conversation I
                    will never forget.
                    Gunjan was born in Chennai as a boy
                    named Sharat. He belonged to a normal
                    middle class family and had two elder sisters.
                    His parents were very keen on their children’s
                    education so they put him in an all boys’
                    school. As he grew a little older, he realized
                    that he had a lot of effeminate characteristics
                    which soon caught society’s eye. “Behave
                    like a boy”, the world told him. He had to
                    face a lot of bullying, verbal abuses and was
                    the butt of all jokes in school. He had no
                    friends. It was a nightmare to go to school
                    every single day and face so much criticism.
                    There were times he used to run to the school
                    washroom and sob uncontrollably. After a lot
                    of contemplation, he realized that he wasn’t
                    living the life he wanted. His parents did not
                    understand him. At a young age of 14, he
                    packed his bags, ran away from home and
                    came to Mumbai.
                    With only Rs.20 in his pocket, he reached
                    Bandra terminus. He was scared and
                    helpless, and on that very day he met a transgender
                    named Menka who offered him a
                    water bottle, heard his story and took him
                    to her place. Menka was a social activist
                    and fought for the rights of the transgender
                    community. She understood
                    Sharat’s plight and was like a mother
                    to him. She supported his decision
                    to become a woman. And thus
                    Sharat transitioned into
                    Gunjan. Gunjan became a
                    part of the ‘hijra samaj’.
                    After two years,
                    she called her parents up to let them know
                    where she was. But sadly they did not accept
                    her. She still craves for their love. However,
                    she did not get dejected. Instead, she made
                    a firm resolution to make her mark in this
                    world. She always knew that education was
                    very important. To fund her education, she
                    began begging in the local trains and at traffic
                    signals by morning, and dancing in a bar at
                    night. After she collected enough money, she
                    decided to join a night college and complete
                    her MCom. This was going to be her sixth
                    interview.
                    “There is a lot of stigma and
                    discrimination. They think we misbehave and
                    are rude. But it’s not entirely our fault. They
                    never accepted us; they do not give us jobs.
                    That’s why my sisters have to beg. My gender
                    does not describe me as a person”, her story
                    brought tears to my eyes. I quickly wiped
                    them and scanned around to see whether
                    anyone was looking. I think she saw that.
                    “But I know I will get this job. It’s my
                    lucky day today and I’m wearing my lucky
                    sari!” I pretended to laugh, but deep down,
                    my heart was filled with empathy. As we
                    reached our destination, I waved goodbye
                    and as I walked outside the train station, I
                    made a silent prayer, hoping she gets the job.
                    How deeply stuck we are to our
                    preconceived notions baffles me. How easily
                    we treat trans-gender people as outcasts and
                    call them names. On April 2014, the Indian
                    Supreme Court declared trans-gender the
                    third gender. It’s almost a year since the ruling
                    and we still treat them so inhumanly. They
                    are still looked down on and are sometimes
                    deprived of basic human rights. The ‘hijras’
                    are not just the ones who clap and beg
                    for money or the ones who perform at
                    ceremonies for good luck. They are
                    normal people with problems, just
                    like us. This was my ‘Kairos’.
                    The moment I realized that
                    I must not judge anyone
                    on the basis of their
                    gender, caste, race or creed.
                    It is their inner beauty that
                    matters. I believe that one day we
                    will live in a country where trans-gender
                    people will be accepted, loved and most
                    importantly respected. Let’s start today. Yes,
                    it will take a long time but it’s not impossible.
                    I never met Gunjan after our train
                    encounter, but every time I board a
                    Churchgate train, I look out for her hoping to
                    hear that she got the job.

                <div>As I look back at my life I realize
                    that, every time I have been rejected from
                    something good, I have actually been
                    redirected to something better. Yes. Life is
                    always at some “TURNING POINT”. Every
                    successful person definitely has a turning
                    point.
                    An APPLE falling from a tree inspired
                    Newton to discover the Laws of Motion.
                    Overflow of WATER from a bath tub,
                    observed by Archimedes, gave the world his
                    Principles of Fluid Mechanics.
                    A moving SPIDER on the wall helped a
                    young Rene Descartes to fulfill his dream of
                    merging Algebra and Geometry as Analytical
                    Geometry.
                    Taxi NUMBER 1729 was the spark in
                    the life of Srinivasa Ramanujan that made him
                    the unmatched hero of Number Theory.
                    Everyone has a break point, turning
                    point, stress point. But what matters is
                    how best these points are understood and
                    utilized to transform life towards SUCCESS.
                    Life is unpredictable. Falling is a part of life.
                    Getting up is living. The turning point
                    can come at the age of 15 or 50. It is
                    like the SUNRISE that provides a safe
                    and bright atmosphere filled with hope
                    and confidence. If we wait too long, we will
                    miss it. It is a tool to fight the past and build
                    the future. When we focus on PROBLEMS
                    we will have more problems. When we
                    focus on POSSIBILITIES we will get more
                    opportunities. Use every opportunity as an
                    HOURGLASS to let the sufferings run down
                    and Disappear.
                    Never close the door on an opportunity.
                    If it knocks on the door, always say YES, and
                    then try to learn how to make the best use of
                    it. It comes to those who are prepared. Our
                    NO will become a YES to someone else. Many
                    of us miss it due to misperception. When a
                    wave comes, go deep and never get scared.
                    When we are in the midst of fear, and stop
                    at the dead end of our path, sometimes we
                    hear a voice saying, ‘do not lose hope, have
                    faith in yourself and move forward, come
                    whatever may’ .Today is not just another day.
                    It is a new chance, another BEGINNING.
                    Embrace it. Nothing is worse than missing an
                    opportunity that can change your life.
                    It is never too late to start over. If we
                    are not happy with yesterday, try something
                    different today and do better. A PESSIMIST
                    sees the difficulty in an opportunity. An
                    OPTIMIST sees the opportunity in every
                    difficulty. All of us do not have equal talents.
                    But all of us have an equal opportunity to
                    develop our talents. We do not have to be
                    great to start, but we have to start to become
                    great. The ladder of SUCCESS is best climbed
                    by stepping on the rings of opportunity. Many
                    of life’s failures are because we do not realize
                    how close we are to success when we give up.
                    Our future is created on, what we DO
                    TODAY and NOT TOMORROW.
                    Life is like FOOTBALL. We have to
                    tackle our problems, block our fears and
                    score goals whenever we get the opportunity.
                    Sometimes, LATER becomes NEVER. Making
                    life big is scary, but what is even scarier is
                    REGRET. We must use obstacles as the
                    stepping stones to build the life we want.
                    The PAIN we feel today is the STRENGTH
                    we will feel tomorrow. For every challenge
                    encountered, there is an opportunity for
                    GROWTH. Take an oath:
                    This moment, this day is as good as any
                    moment. I shall make this day a HEAVEN on
                    earth.
                    The ADVENTURE of life is to LEARN
                    The PURPOSE of life is to GROW
                    The NATURE of life is to CHANGE
                    The CHALLENGE of life is to OVERCOME
                    The SECRET of life is to dare.
                    Trust that God brings every person, every
                    opportunity into our life to get us what we
                    want and to where we need to be. Let every
                    moment be a TURNING POINT that leads to
                    success and happiness in life.

                <div><i>‘Freedom isn’t a tea party, India. Freedom is
                    a war.’</i><br/>
                    A war against the constant attempts
                    to derail democracy, a war against the
                    macabre slaughter of reason, a war
                    against the barbaric ideals and beliefs
                    with the solitary purpose of thwarting
                    and shunting growth which manage
                    to survive under the guise of rights
                    and liberties, and a war to let an
                    idea, a thought to exist and
                    see its day without being
                    assaulted and forced
                    behind the gates of bans, its only offence
                    being guilty of offending someone.
                    Taking offence has become one
                    of those ineluctable fashion fads which
                    supersede one another, always to serve as a
                    subject of grave concern for the impuissant
                    majority, seeking those precious fifteen
                    minutes to star in their “breaking news” and
                    hog the offended posters. Shedding crocodile
                    tears and feigning distress about things
                    people rarely comprehend is sadly in vogue
                    today. Society in the current decade, which
                    has seen a huge change in power dynamics,
                    has certainly become more regressive as it
                    assumed the role of being the upholder of
                    tradition. People either want their way or the
                    ban way. The government too, has shown
                    little resistance in letting people have their
                    way. The entire process of taking offence
                    is initiated by the powerless, who coveting
                    the media limelight, yell offence and have
                    a phalanx of dolts at the ready, armed with
                    ink, which coincidentally is the ammunition
                    of literary battles. The ban of literary genius
                    Salman Rushdie’s Satanic Verses, the forced
                    exile of the well renowned painter M.F.
                    Hussain, the ban on beef and the arrest of
                    comedian Kiku Sharda over the lampoon of a
                    self-proclaimed divine messenger in a snazzy
                    costume are the frivolous and ridiculous
                    schemes of the vain and self-interested
                    political leaders yearning to please the
                    offended for their treasured vote bank. The
                    media joins in the bandwagon with their
                    prime time slots reserved for the ban-yelling,
                    ink-wielding, FIR-lodging, office-ransacking,
                    “outraged and offended” .Take for instance
                    the AIB roast. Newspapers printed a great
                    many useless and exaggerated things with
                    the sole purpose of drawing attention to
                    themselves and out-shouting the others.
                    Celebrities thronged in to dish out
                    their views to ensure not to be left
                    out. TV reporters made it a point
                    to do their duty of getting a
                    bite from every offended
                    person except for dear India TV that religiously aired
                    their coverage of levitating
                    mountains and self-incinerating
                    phoenixes. All this hullaballoo when
                    the creators explicitly warned the feeble
                    hearted to avoid the episode!
                    In this chronic upsurge of taking
                    offence, the ones who leap in the forefront
                    are the ministers without ministries, the
                    journalists without stories, the aunties
                    without gossip, bulging middle-aged men
                    in shorts and the hypocritical god men with
                    misunderstood scriptures. With an army at
                    their disposal, the only way to stop them
                    from getting offended is to offend them
                    even more until we drain the very last bit of
                    offence from them. The hour, the minute we
                    decide to drive this flaw out from our society,
                    we will take a giant step towards making this
                    country the heaven of freedom spoken about
                    by Rabindranath Tagore. So let’s make this
                    our ‘kairotic moment’. Go Grab your pens
                    and flaunt your inked faces while keeping in
                    mind what Aristotle said, ‘It is the mark of
                    an educated mind to be able to entertain a
                    thought without accepting it’.

                    -Terri Guillemets
                    When I first came across these
                    powerful words, I did not fully understand
                    their significance as I continued being tugged
                    and pulled by the ebb and flow of life. As is
                    the case with most of us, I rarely paused to
                    stop and think about personal tragedies that
                    occur to others. In the past, my normal
                    reaction was to express meaningless,
                    unfelt sympathy and to carry on chasing
                    my dreams and ambitions. In short, I
                    would get sucked into the vortex of my
                    every day, fast-paced life. I was not really
                    affected by the personal tragedies of others,
                    nor did I realize the enormity of the situation.
                    It was only when I saw at close quarters,
                    how two families close to me, coped with
                    their immense problems and responded to
                    them, that I realized how my perspective was
                    narrow, selfish and limited.
                    In the first instance, there was this
                    neighbor of mine, who died of a progressively
                    debilitating illness called Parkinson’s disease.
                    After battling with it for over sixteen years,
                    he finally breathed his last. This individual’s
                    encounter with Parkinson’s also became the
                    family’s war against it. I saw with admiration,
                    how each member rallied round the patriarch
                    and gave him all their love, care and emotional
                    support unflinchingly. Of course, it took a toll
                    on their finances and severely restricted their
                    lifestyles, but they carried on uncomplaining.
                    In another poignant case, I saw true
                    love, dedication and commitment shine
                    through. This is the true story of a young
                    woman, let me call her Sona. She had a loving
                    husband and two lovely children. She had a
                    shining career, was deeply involved with the
                    progress of her children, and looked after her
                    family, including her father-in-law. However,
                    her normal existence came to a stop when
                    she was felled by a tragic stroke. In the
                    blink of an eye, the entire family’s life came
                    crashing down. She lay in a deep coma for
                    over three weeks, and the doctors did not
                    hold out much hope. When she did emerge
                    from her coma, I saw that she was fated to
                    lead a bed-ridden life of dependence. The
                    slightest movements like hugging and kissing
                    her children, or speaking to them became impossible tasks. My heart went out to her
                    husband and children for their lives were
                    shattered. Life, in my opinion, had become a
                    sheer drudgery for them.
                    When I looked at both the families,
                    I was acutely aware of the hopelessness of
                    the situation. When I saw the sufferings of
                    the individuals as well as those of their loved
                    ones, I privately thought that blissful death
                    would be preferable to a living death. When
                    death finally claimed the life of my neighbor,
                    who was suffering from Parkinson’s, I thought
                    it was a blessed relief for all those concerned.
                    However, I revised this opinion a few years
                    later, when I saw beautiful, vivacious Sona
                    and her family fight for normalcy in their lives.
                    As the months and years passed by,
                    I became aware of a lighter atmosphere
                    pervading the house, as they rejoiced in her
                    minor triumphs towards progress. I saw the
                    single-minded devotion and purpose with
                    which her husband contributed towards it,
                    ungrudgingly nursing her and carrying out
                    his responsibilities as a father and head of
                    the family. I saw the children put aside their
                    wants and desires and always considered
                    their mother’s needs. Sona did not give way
                    to despair, despondency or depression. She
                    worked hard for the slightest improvement
                    in her condition! She listened to everyone’s
                    troubles, gave them advice and consoled
                    them, when the others ought to have been
                    doing it to her. She had come a long way, and
                    as the years passed by, she still continued
                    to be her level-headed, cheerful self. All this
                    was possible because of her whole-hearted
                    co-operation, her intense faith in God and
                    her hope of regaining the ability to walk,
                    talk and be independent.
                    That was my moment of
                    illumination, my supreme ‘Kairos’
                    of awareness. I realized that
                    though life might be unjust
                    and not work out the way
                    we want it to, when we
                    ask for something immediately and it does
                    not always come; despite the odds, despite
                    the hopelessness, we have to battle on.
                    How one does it depends on the individuals
                    concerned. One could give up the fight,
                    become nasty and self-centered, or as is the
                    case with Sona and my neighbour, one could
                    find a way out and face the odds cheerfully
                    without railing at fate or God.
                    To turn adversity into hope is the
                    lesson of life I learnt. Now I fully understand
                    and appreciate the message contained in the
                    following evergreen words of comfort and
                    inspiration:
                    <i>“Whispering hope, oh how welcome thy
                        voice
                        Making my heart in its sorrow rejoice”</i>
                    Our lives are infused with pain and
                    suffering. Hope enables us to overcome
                    hardship, motivates us to persevere despite
                    the darkness, reassures us and encourages
                    us to journey onwards, despite obstacles
                    and despite not knowing how, or when, or
                    where, or why. Our life’s story will conclude.
                    Hope is a signature strength that improves
                    our well-being; providing peace of mind,
                    contentment and life satisfaction. Instead of
                    treating life like a graveyard of buried hopes,
                    we should understand that hope motivates
                    a person to achieve a desired outcome, to
                    overcome hardships, to keep trying and
                    to keep hoping despite the small odds of
                    success. I no longer desire to be the hardheaded
                    rationalist, tearing away the mask
                    of illusion from people’s faces. Instead, I
                    tend to agree with Christopher Reeves, the
                    Hollywood actor, who became a quadriplegic
                    after a riding accident and could only breathe
                    through a ventilator, <i>“Once you choose
                        hope, anything’s possible.”</i>

                <div class="english-title">AUSPICIOUS-SUPERSTITION</div>
                <div>At the turn of the century, people
                    across the world had grand dreams of the
                    future. From hover boards to flying cars and
                    inter-galactic travel. However, the only thing
                    that was certainly going to change was the
                    calendar (chronos).
                    Be it new year’s eve or other auspicious
                    days, longing for, and honoring a special time
                    (kairos) has been one of humanity’s most
                    enduring endeavors. The idea that the gods
                    of the sky could foretell the unpredictable
                    ways of mother earth fascinated many early
                    civilizations. Maybe it was the idea that these
                    times, that brought prosperity (harvest) or
                    wrath (winter) were times when God was
                    somehow closer, and to an extent tangible.
                    The ancient Greeks perceived this
                    differently; they understood that not all
                    time was equal. But also believed that the
                    occurrence of a ‘special time’ was firmly
                    in their hands. In Panathenaicus, Isocrates
                    wrote, educated people are those, “who
                    manage well the circumstances which they
                    encounter day by day, and who possess
                    a judgment which is accurate in meeting
                    occasions as they arise and rarely misses the
                    expedient course of action”.
                    This realization of our control over
                    the moments in our life that define our
                    destiny opens our eyes to the value of every
                    moment. A person falling sick, a death and an
                    accident may all seem like moments of pure
                    sadness and unpleasantness but are actually
                    opportunities to reach out to grieving people
                    forging stronger bonds with them; while a
                    small seemingly insignificant action can lead
                    to a forest fire or stoke a riot.
                    Rest assured, the position of
                    the sun in the sky or the aligning of
                    five planets will never be responsible
                    for any of the successes or failures faced
                    in life. ‘Kairotic’ moments occur amidst a
                    sea of ‘chronos’.But every moment has the
                    potential to be a Kairos.
                    Throughout the day, God hands each
                    of us opportunities to be his instrument in
                    other people’s lives. Seizing the moment
                    and exploiting the opportunity at hand is
                    the difference between a life of mediocrity
                    and one of awesomeness. Often, we pray
                    fervently for something and expect the
                    ‘kairotic’ moment of deliverance to be a
                    dramatic manifestation. Like the parting of
                    the red sea. However, the reality is rarely that
                    miraculous and can be logically explained.

                <div class="english-title">DADDA’S LITTLE GIRL</div>
                <div>We were a perfect family of four until
                    I realized that heaven had different plans for
                    us. Be it weeks, months or years, the pain
                    of losing my dad will pinch me for the rest
                    of my life. Little did I know that he would
                    never return home that day, that it was the
                    last time I was seeing his face, that I would
                    never have someone to get me my favourite
                    candies anymore, that he would never see me
                    become an engineer, and that I would never
                    have my hero walk me down the aisle on my
                    big day. It has been three months now. Life
                    hasn’t been easy and feels like it never will.
                    Nothing that people say makes sense right
                    now. Sometimes, I wish I could turn back the
                    clock just to hug him tight and never let go…
                    I called him my ‘walrus-daddy’ cause
                    of his huge built and soft heart. We shared a
                    perfect father-daughter relationship, where I
                    could pour my heart out to him without the
                    fear of being judged. He was an obedient
                    son, a loving husband and a wonderful father.
                    Dadda didn’t tell me how to live life; he lived
                    and let me watch him do it. I realized that any
                    man could be a father but it takes a real man
                    to be a ‘Dad’! Also, they say hard times help
                    you push your limits and test your strength.
                    I figured out how true that was when I was
                    back to college the day just after I lost him.
                    I gave my practical exam and headed back
                    to school that evening to run the alumni race
                    only to return home winning it. All I could
                    do was look up to the heavens and smile,
                    knowing that he was watching me. He carried
                    me in his arms. Today, I carry him in my heart.
                    I know this for real that no matter whose love
                    gives me happiness, I’ll never find any like his.
                    His memories will remain etched in my heart
                    forever. I know he’s having a blast up there
                    and I can’t wait to meet him again! Until then,
                    those brisk winks and flying kisses to the sky
                    will continue and I will live to make him smile.

                <div class="english-title">GIRL ON THE DESK</div>
                <div>The roaring motorcycle engine
                    shuddered to a halt as he pulled into one of
                    Santacruz’s dimly lit bylanes. On a whim he
                    decided to haunt the spot for a bit longer.
                    He bought a Cornetto from the dusty old
                    general store nearby and leaned against
                    the bike, enjoying the state of isolation.
                    Across the street was a
                    photocopy booth, ‘ZEROX’
                    misspelt in bold across their
                    banner. Their printer room,
                    housing all the expensive
                    machinery, had a light on to ward off deviant
                    minds. Against this light, he perceived a
                    silhouette, basking in the shaded comfort of
                    the outer desk.
                    Her face was illuminated by the
                    lighter’s flame as she lit up a cigarette. She
                    had a round but pretty face and wore a leather
                    jacket over a red dress. In the familiarity of
                    his surroundings, the stranger’s presence
                    piqued his curiosity. “I must talk to this girl,”
                    he thought. Disposing of the remains of his
                    Cornetto, he walked up to her. “Where’d
                    you get that smoke?” he asked, knowing,
                    the only spot anyone could procure any sort
                    of contraband at that ungodly hour was the
                    lone chaiwala who usually parked a good
                    kilometer away. “What?” she retorted, her
                    voice soft and melodic even in her startled
                    state. “The smoke. Where’d you get one
                    around here?” he reiterated, with the most
                    cringe-worthy grin he could summon. Her
                    face stretched into an angelic smile as she
                    pointed to the lane’s end. As he turned his
                    head, his face fell with a single glance, having
                    realized that the cursed chaiwala had picked
                    that very corner as his base of operation
                    that day. Shooting another grin, he walked
                    away towards his malicious antagonist. He
                    bought a single Marlboro and walked back
                    to his bike. His yearning to communicate his
                    curiosity was strong, but his courage had
                    now failed him. He lifted his hand in salute
                    as he lit up. She returned the gesture with
                    another smile. Sweet mercies! She soon got
                    done and began to walk to the other end
                    without sparing him another look. It was the
                    last time he ever saw her, as she turned at
                    the corner, ‘the girl on the desk’. He’d dueled
                    loss before, knowing all the usual emotions
                    in its company, but in that moment he didn’t
                    feel any of them, only a dull ache at the
                    bottom of his chest. She could’ve been
                    anyone, meant anything—a friend,
                    an acquaintance, a fleeting muse,
                    even “The One”. He had let
                    his opportunity slip away, even with Lord Kairos smiling
                    down from the heavens.
                    Stubbing out death, he woke the
                    roaring beast and rode back to the
                    promise of warmth and comfort.
                    Life is a winding road, with its ups and
                    downs, sharp turns and sudden forks. Each
                    path you see leads to an unknown destiny.
                    This is why it is ruled by the choices you
                    make. Opportunities aren’t always made to
                    be grasped. Let some slip away like sand
                    through your fingers. Although things are
                    meant to end, they may also be a means to
                    an end. Weigh each choice like you know
                    your destination.

                <div>life that fell in the ‘Kairos’ category, I came
                    up short. If asked about their Kairos, others
                    would probably recount some life-altering
                    experiences. It was then that it occurred
                    to me! What about the smaller moments in
                    life? The ones that made a difference, but
                    had been chalked up as everyday stuff. Like
                    getting butterflies in my stomach when the
                    guy I like smiles at me, or that feeling of
                    triumph when I prove someone wrong. It’s
                    that moment when inspiration struck and
                    enabled me to put pencil to paper.
                    Kairos means the right or opportune
                    moment, derived from the Greek God of
                    Opportunity, Caerus. Caerus, though said
                    to be handsome, had absolutely no sense
                    of style. According to legend, he had a long
                    fringe in the front and was absolutely bald
                    at the back. So our little Hermeswannabe
                    (yes, he had wings on his feet
                    too) could easily be seized by the hair
                    hanging over his face when he was arriving.
                    But once he passed by, no one could grasp
                    him. The back of his head being bald. This
                    led to the phrase “seize the opportunity”.
                    But not all of my ‘kairotic’ moments
                    were of the ‘carpe diem’ variety. Some
                    existed right in front of me. I just had to
                    open my eyes to see and appreciate them.
                    It’s those little moments that happened often
                    but I hadn’t taken the time to notice.
                    They were everyday moments like
                    joking with friends on the hour-long walk
                    home, or the pleasure I felt when someone
                    complimented my sketch of the day. Also
                    times like, when I managed that fluke headshot
                    and the guys cheered like crazy, or when
                    my code was finally bug-free (or so it seemed).
                    It was these moments that made my
                    life unique and if not for them I wouldn’t be
                    where I am.

                    precious little moments in your life too? Dig

                <div class="english-title">RAYS OF HAPPINESS</div>
                <div>Lethargically walking up the slope
                    to college, dreaming of what the day could
                    possibly have in store for me, out of the blue,
                    a little finger tugged at my hand. I turned
                    around to a little girl saying, “Didi Didi! My
                    mother wants to talk to you”. Shaken out of
                    my reverie, I saw a weary eyed woman in a
                    drab sari staring at me intently.
                    “Could you please do me a favour?”
                    she mumbled. Strange ideas ran through my
                    mind, wondering what she could want from
                    me. Just before I could refuse, she went on
                    to say, “My daughter is giving her SSC boards
                    this year. She will be the first educated girl in
                    our family. A little guidance here and there
                    will boost her to go ahead. I know you can do
                    this. God will bless you!” I was taken aback.
                    ‘Maa ki dua se Zindagi Jannat Se Kum Nahi
                    Hoti … Jannat toh insaan ke naseeb mei hona
                    ek alag hi ehasaas hai’, these lines once said
                    by my aunt to somebody came to my mind.
                    My mind started racing and I wondered
                    if I’d be able to do justice to the faith she
                    had in me. I had kept away from NSS and
                    other social service programs as I barely had
                    any time to spare and wanted to focus on
                    my academics. Here, I was at a crossroads,
                    deciding to help an unknown person with nil
                    rewards, just 100 meters away from college.
                    Nevertheless, I went ahead just for
                    the kick of doing something different. It was
                    an unusual experience— managing college,
                    projects, assignments and teaching from
                    scratch. Many thought I was being stupid in
                    going out of my way to help somebody who
                    didn’t have much scope. But the inner joy
                    that it gave me was indescribable.
                    To cut the long story short, weeks
                    turned to months, and with a little extra
                    coaching, she gave her Board Exams. I didn’t
                    hear from her for three months after the
                    exam. Coming out of college one day, after
                    my dismal performance in my semester,
                    apprehensive of the magnitude of drama
                    awaiting me at home, I stopped in my
                    tracks when I heard the familiar “Didi,
                    Didi!” I was filled with nostalgia. I
                    turned around to see my ebullient
                    student, beaming with joy and
                    offering me a box of sweets.
                    The excitement in the Doeshaped
                    eyes said it all. I
                    saw her mother standing at a distance, her
                    eyes filled with pride. That was my ‘kairos’; it
                    made me believe in my existence.

                        My family and I had just joined the incredibly

                <div>“Offo! Do I need to change your diaper
                    again?” my grandma stared, wide-eyed, at
                    those beady black eyes as they stared back,
                    empty.
                    “All the time, like a baby! You should make
                    some effort to get up too. I cannot lift you
                    alone”, she said.
                    “You keep quiet! I cannot get up if you keep
                    talking”, he said.
                    “This is what I get for helping”, she muttered.
                    “I did not ask for your help”, he retorted.
                    This was daily drama; like that running
                    in old heritage theatres every day, without a
                    slight change. The old couple would quarrel
                    like children, one out of exhaustion and the
                    other out of helplessness.
                    With Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s
                    combined, for Grandpa, life was like one
                    of those nightmares in which the monster
                    chases you, but neither can you escape nor
                    call for help because you are paralyzed and
                    mute at the same time. Getting up was like
                    going for a test. A trip to the washroom
                    was as tiring as mountain trekking. Eating
                    was a pain in the neck, with all those dietary
                    restrictions, and bed was the only place of
                    comfort and solace. In addition to all this, a
                    physiotherapy session every Wednesday that
                    felt like an approaching Monday.
                    This is just a small glimpse of
                    what the second infancy brought to
                    grandpa. He would often recite
                    those catchy phrases from TV
                    ads randomly, talk about incidents which never took
                    place, and sometimes even forget
                    who we were. For most of the time, he
                    would sit on his chair and gaze emptily into
                    the space at his front, where Grandma would
                    appear from time to time to cater to him.
                    I remember that day when Grandma fell
                    ill and we took care of them. His day started
                    as usual. He woke up, had his breakfast,
                    spent the afternoon watching TV, blabbered
                    trivial things at odd times. He was indifferent.
                    But of course, he wasn’t to be blamed. It was
                    the work of those witches inside his head,
                    posing in the form of Alzheimer’s. Grandma
                    on the other hand kept worrying about him
                    all day, “Did he get up? If he doesn’t wake up
                    on time, he’ll get acidity”, “Take him to the
                    loo or he’ll wet his pants”, “Feed him minced
                    food, he cannot chew properly”.
                    Late into midnight, we had retired
                    to bed. I was wide awake and unable to
                    sleep. That was when I heard faint sounds of
                    movement coming from Grandpa’s bedroom.
                    I rushed to his room.
                    There he was, woken up and
                    approaching Grandma’s side. He moved very
                    slowly, inching forward with the help of his
                    tripod stick that he’d diffidently use in front
                    of everyone. I watched him silently as he
                    sat beside her pillow, slowly and firmly. He
                    laced his hand over her forehead and started
                    humming a soft tune. I remained a silent
                    spectator, like the bed and the mirror, invisible
                    to him. It was inconceivable to imagine him
                    get up on his own at such a stage, recalling
                    what effort it takes us to help him out of
                    the chair every day. Those stern muscles
                    just wouldn’t move, no matter how much he
                    tried. That incredible night, I witnessed a feat
                    of love - a tender, delectable moment that
                    showed love triumphs over everything.

                <div class="english-title">CARPE KAIROS</div>
                <div>I had tears in my eyes, laughing at
                    some perverse comment that my friend had
                    made along with my other vagabond friends
                    who were chilling on the beach with me.
                    I was sprawled like a starfish on the sand
                    without caring about the fact that my mom
                    would probably bite my ear off for dirtying
                    my newly washed jeans.
                    We had to stop goofing around for
                    some time, as a kid around 10 years old
                    approached within hearing distance. That kid
                    would probably have been scandalized as our
                    talks needed PG(Parental Guidance). As we
                    stared at him as if he was an extraterrestrial
                    being flying a UFO (just joking), he lost his
                    concentration and stared back at us with
                    curious cautious eyes forgetting about his
                    kite that flew away. Disheartened, he stared
                    at us and then back at his kite drifting away.
                    My sweet friend chatted with him
                    and took him to buy a kite. Looking at the
                    two chat like long lost friends and walking
                    away, brought a smile to my face. (What?
                    Don’t judge. It was a cute thing to do okay).
                    Reminiscing my good old childhood days
                    I slipped away from a world of Techmax,
                    software development project and all that
                    jazz that engineers keep thinking about, into
                    a world of, toe curling laughter watching
                    Jerry beat Tom repeatedly, mischievous
                    smiles after stealing candy from the fridge
                    and where making something out of legos
                    was an accomplishment. (Sighs)
                    I was brought out of my stupor by the
                    two desolate boys walking towards us with
                    forlorn expressions. The kite seller had left
                    for the day and now they were left without
                    a kite. Seeing the kid in tears, we asked him
                    what he would like to eat. He pointed towards
                    the gola walla saying he’d love to have a
                    ‘chammach gola’ (his words, not mine). We
                    went towards the gola walla and stood by
                    the side chatting while he was preparing the
                    gola for him.
                    All this while, the kid looked at the
                    gola like his prized possession, mesmerized
                    by the way the crushed pieces of ice were
                    put together to form his ‘chammach gola’.
                    The sparkle in his eyes and the way he
                    opened his mouth and then closed it, gaping
                    at the glass in front of him that the maker
                    of the masterpiece had set in front of him,
                    was magical. The “thank you didi” that
                    came from him didn’t reach my ears as I was
                    dumbfounded thinking about how a gola
                    that cost 30 rupees could make someone so
                    happy. A gola!
                    Later that night when I was making a
                    list of all the tasks for the next day, I wrote
                    down the saying “Carpe Diem” at the end
                    of the page. Seize the day! How ironic! I’m
                    sure at some point everyone has written this
                    phrase down only to shred it into pieces by
                    the end of the day, to vent some frustration
                    of the entire day. The clock ticks every second
                    and the pressure cooker whistles every time
                    you make a wrong move telling you that
                    you’re not going to like the end result. And
                    in the meantime, the mantra “Carpe Diem”
                    feels like nothing but a sheer mockery of
                    our robotic lives. We are running in this
                    race of getting a 10 pointer, semester
                    after semester. Doing an internship,
                    getting into the best companies
                    and finally getting married.
                    To do what? Finding that
                    euphoric feeling that will
                    be our own Kairotic moment? But will this
                    race ever end?
                    The happiness that shone in that kid’s
                    eyes as bright as the Kohinoor taught me
                    a lesson. It’s not about the entire day; it is
                    not just about having everything. It’s about
                    making something worthwhile out of the little
                    things you’ve done. It’s not about seizing
                    the entire day but it is about seizing a few
                    moments worth treasuring that will help you
                    get through the entire day.
                    So rather than Carpe Diem...
                    Carpe a few Kairoi every day!

                    -Charles Darwin<br/>
                    Charles Darwin, Walt Disney, Isaac
                    Newton, Thomas Edison, Albert Einstein and
                    many other successful personalities faced a
                    lot of criticism during their formative years.
                    But those criticisms did not bring down
                    their zeal or their thirst for success. It rather
                    motivated them to prove their worth to
                    the many critics around them which is why
                    they are remembered even today for their
                    successful inventions.
                    Why talk about the past? People today
                    as well, are faced with a lot of criticism.
                    Be it a student who hasn’t been able
                    to successfully get through a medical
                    entrance and chooses something
                    else instead of the medical
                    stream, or even people
                    who haven’t been able to achieve something are
                    always talked about by society.
                    But setting all of this aside, what is
                    more important is that the individual
                    who at first had given up due to his failures,
                    now decides to sit back, think, ponder and
                    get set for a new adventure that is still yet to
                    come. The ultimate decision for taking that
                    one step towards a new future rests only on
                    that one individual. One has to think about
                    the new road that has suddenly appeared
                    and how one can make the best of it. One
                    needs to collect one’s thoughts and get
                    ready to move onto something that involves
                    change, something that involves transition—
                    from old thoughts to something completely
                    new. No matter what obstacles life has given
                    him in the past, the individual who is on this
                    new journey needs to forget the past, learn
                    from it and step ahead with conviction, but
                    this time with more enthusiasm.
                    Considering the new path now! When
                    one decides to move on with the new way
                    that has opened up, there comes a time when
                    one is half way through to achieve that new
                    goal. At that time when the individual puts on
                    his thinking cap to really compare situations
                    of the past and the present, the individual
                    realizes that this path has really brought
                    something good, this path was something
                    that was destined, this was something
                    really planned to happen in his life. Now
                    this individual is quite content with what he
                    has achieved till date. No matter how far an
                    individual moves on or how much he achieves
                    in life, there is always that one moment when
                    he looks back to wonder why whatever
                    happened led him to taking a new step.
                    This is what you call, “Living a Kairos
                    Life in a Chronos world.” We should always
                    live our days looking for those moments,
                    those inexplicable times when God’s will and
                    his ways intersect our daily walks of
                    life. And trust me, this could happen
                    anytime! A friend could call you out of
                    the blue and give you a good word or a
                    colleague could take a moment aside and
                    lend you a hand. God is always surprising
                    us with His perfect, kairos time. But are we
                    willing to embrace the occasion?

                <div class="english-title">NEW YEAR RESOLUTION</div>
                <div>Days, weeks, months and years go by;
                    time is flying. Every year, we think, plan and
                    make resolutions for the coming year for it to
                    be great, memorable, full of joy and so that it
                    fulfills our dreams. However, everyone feels
                    the need to limit these resolutions to their
                    feasibility and completeness. Resolutions can
                    be as small as ‘throwing wrappers/plastics in
                    dustbins’, ’restricting ourselves from spitting
                    on the road’, ‘avoiding the use of abusive
                    language’, ‘following traffic rules’, etc.
                    Positive attitude and energy is what
                    we need to give more emphasis to. We need
                    to nurture the good qualities required in an
                    individual. The same is nicely described by the
                    famous Marathi writer P. K. Atre in this stanza:
                    “Deh devaache mandir jashi usaat ho
                    saakhar tasa dehat Parmeshwar”
                    God resides in every individual; to
                    elaborate this, he has given us an example
                    of sugarcane from which sugar is extracted.
                    The Lord resides in every person with some
                    good qualities. Godliness can be shown to
                    the society by carrying out initiatives for
                    certain social causes which help the poor and
                    downtrodden.
                    Another very important aspect which
                    we should be aware of is that we should never
                    be egoistic. One should be proud of what he
                    has achieved but should not be flattered by
                    it. One can achieve laurels in his life but he
                    still needs to be simple. Again, let me take
                    the help of a famous line from the Abhanga:
                    “ Maati bole kumbhaaraala ka paayee
                    tudavishi,
                    tuzaach aahe shevat vedya maazhya
                    paayashi”
                    However big an individual might
                    become, he has to realize that he has been
                    raised from soil and will ultimately return to
                    the same soil. Whatever your achievements,
                    the destination of every life is death. We
                    are sent to the earth for some specific
                    tasks and we need to strive to attain them.
                    It is not you but your works which will last
                    forever. For youngsters, it is very necessary
                    to show perseverance and diligence to
                    achieve the goals set for them in the fields
                    of education, technology, sports, culture,
                    etc. The line by a Gyanpeeth award winning
                    Marathi writer says everything about it:
                    “Vaasantik mand pavnaane aandolit
                    zhaalelyaa mandaar manjirichyaa bhovati
                    madhugunjarava
                    karnaarya milindapramane maanasachi
                    manovrutti asaavi”
                    One needs to be focused like a
                    honeybee and always be in search of
                    something that will add value to one’s career.
                    If we stick to the basics and follow our
                    resolutions for the year, they naturally get
                    fulfilled.

                <div class="english-title">BLISSFULLY IGNORANT</div>
                <div>It was a Sunday evening and one of our
                    routinely visits to the Siddhivinayak temple.
                    My family and I had just joined the incredibly
                    long queue that snaked its way into the
                    temple’s sanctum. The line grew steadily as
                    we paced forward, inch by inch, restlessly,
                    hoping we’d make it quick till the entrance.
                    The temple’s compound held numerous stalls,
                    all of them selling laddus and other sweets,
                    garlands and other merchandise. We bought
                    a garland and a plate of ‘offerings’ at one of
                    the stalls before entering the line.
                    A while later and deeper into the
                    queue, I noticed a thin, young girl holding a
                    basket of garlands coming towards the queue.
                    She wore a ragged frock of fading pink. She
                    approached random people in the crowd to
                    sell garlands, but most of us had one and
                    would turn down her offer. I watched her as she
                    hopped over the red tiles, carefully avoiding
                    the yellow ones as they alternately dressed
                    the floor. Her foot stopped beside mine.
                    “Didi, mala Bhagwaan ke liye”, she
                    showed me her basket of garlands. I politely
                    refused.
                    “Ok didi, nexsht time!” she winked
                    and turned away, proceeding further, into the
                    black of the night. Would the girl hop the red
                    tiles the same way selling her garlands years
                    later? I wondered.
                    Children are so blissfully ignorant.
                    Having stepped into adulthood, all of us
                    begin looking at life through different
                    colored glasses—sometimes red and
                    frustrated, sometimes blue and somber,
                    yellow and bright or grey and dull. Time
                    isn’t playtime anymore. Not all men
                    are good uncles or women good
                    aunties. We finally come to realize and understand the
                    world. Our shoulders become
                    heavy with responsibilities as we
                    blend ourselves into the mundaneness
                    of work life. We work to earn, earn to live.
                    We work and work, and eagerly anticipate
                    the weekend holidays. And once they’re
                    spent, wait a long way until the next. We
                    forget to cherish life as we live. Life’s no
                    longer a wonderland, and reality tugs at our
                    shoulders.
                    Yet, it isn’t a bad idea to get blissfully
                    ignorant once in a while and dance our way
                    through wonderland, carefully hopping over
                    just the red tiles, leaving the yellows...Nay?

                    Moreover,the Ivy League is expensive.
                    Many meritorious students aroundthe world
                    cannot afford the cost that can be anywhere
                    between 160000 – 200000 US$ for a 4-year
                    UG programme.
                    Thus,the Ivy League is beyond reach
                    for students from the middle class or lower
                    middle class. In a sense,the Ivy League is not
                    only a hall mark of world class education and
                    research but is also a symbol of social elitism.
                    However, my visit to these two
                    campuses was incredibly exhilarating and
                    awe inspiring. These are creations of many
                    innovative minds and fruits of selfless work
                    by many dedicated souls to give the world an
                    experience of great learning and motivation
                    for original work in any field of knowledge.
                    Here is a campus of emerging minds that
                    endeavour to follow the motto of the
                    university: Light and Truth.
                    Long live the Ivy League.

                    I was left without a clue<br/>
                    Didn’t know the next thing left to do<br/>
                    Staring blankly at the cloudy sky<br/>
                    I didn’t think we’d ever say goodbye<br/>
                    I just came here to meet you<br/>
                    Can’t hold my tears anymore<br/>
                    You swore you would always stay<br/>
                    You said that you’d never go away<br/>
                    I think of our time together<br/>
                    And for a minute I do feel better<br/>
                    But then it comes pouring back in<br/>
                    Gripping my throat, I can’t breathe<br/>
                    All the promises you never kept<br/>
                    I’m left alone standing at your grave<br/>
                    I’m broken in two, do you even know?<br/>
                    Oh tell me, did you really have to go?<br/>
                    Just then my tears hit the gravestone<br/>
                    And I look down at the roses I left you<br/>
                    They’re still fresh and beaming red<br/>
                    Scarcely haunted by the dead<br/>
                    It felt as if they’re looking at me<br/>
                    As if they’re smiling, smiling lovingly<br/>
                    That’s when it struck me<br/>
                    And that was the moment I knew<br/>
                    You’re gone but you’re not really gone<br/>
                    Maybe in a better place but never far<br/>
                    You’re right there watching over me<br/>
                    I know you’re smiling, smiling lovingly<br/>
                    And that moment was enough to keep me going on<br/></div>

                    It all starts like a flash in my mind<br/>
                    Out of nowhere my mind does suddenly find<br/>
                    An idea to express this time<br/>
                    And make it more gripping with some words to rhyme<br/>
                    Permutations and combinations begin from then<br/>

                    Slowly and gradually it becomes long<br/>
                    The words moving to places where they belong<br/>
                    Sometimes the words come rather slow<br/>
                    While sometimes they are in full flow<br/>
                    After some challenging brainstorming sessions<br/>
                    I finally arrive at a line of conclusion<br/>
                    What started out as an idea in my mind<br/>

                    have successfully created reusable rockets that have achieved vertical landing after launch. Not
                    only does this triumph make space travel cheaper but before the safe landing of Falcon 9, landing
                    a rocket safely on Earth was a feat achieved by rockets merely in science fiction movies.
                    Transcending into unfathomable dimensions, we strive to find meaning in the chaos of
                    change encompassing us. A struggle so disconcerting that as we sit here writing this editorial in
                    front of 9 million pixels throwing light back at us in a manner which can provide us information
                    about almost anything there is, it is hard to fathom ways in which incredible advancements in
                    technology have transformed our lives.
                    Artificial General Intelligence, Virtual Reality, Nanotech computing, electric
                    avenues are dreams today which could be a part of our daily lives in the next 50
                    or 5 years. This exponential technological expansion will always
                    leave us with one question; is it for better or worse?
                    As we leave you to ponder on that, we, the technical editors of
                    FragMag 2016 take immense pleasure to invite you to

                <div>Anyone with their fingers even
                    remotely close to the pulse of gaming knows
                    that e-sports have blown up in popularity
                    over the past few years. With thousands of
                    gamers competing and millions watching,
                    the phenomenon has come a long way in a
                    very short period of time. A recent world
                    championship of DotA 2, the International,
                    had a prize pool of 18 million USD and had
                    peak time viewership of 8.5 million, beating
                    the 8.1 million views of the GoT Season
                    5 finale. It is baffling to even imagine a
                    videogame, which involves moving little
                    wizards around on the screen, commanding
                    such respect.
                    I started playing DotA as a hobby. Now
                    after nearly 1600 hours of game play over 18
                    months, it has become an intractable part of
                    the fabric of my life as a twenty-something. I
                    couldn’t stop playing it without compromising
                    dozens of friendships, opportunities and so
                    on. If I started out thinking of DotA 2 as a
                    complicated video game and moved on to
                    thinking of it as a form of performance, I now
                    think of it almost exclusively as a sport. Much
                    of what I used to understand as creative or
                    social challenges- getting 5 people to work
                    in harmony with one another, experimenting
                    with the opportunities afforded by the hero
                    pool- I now think of in terms of organized
                    competition and self improvement. DotA 2
                    isn’t a toy box anymore; it’s a test. It’s as wall
                    to be climbed, an encounter with a system
                    that demands respect and doesn’t owe you
                    anything.
                    While playing the game is entertaining,
                    that’s no longer the reason I do it.
                    I play DotA to get better at DotA;
                    to learn something, alone or with my
                    friends, and to apply that understanding
                    over and over again in a dozen different
                    configurations. Play is practice, and practice
                    is both gratifying an utterly, mood-crushingly
                    frustrating. It’s a fundamentally different
                    approach to games than what is considered
                    to be ‘mainstream’ or ‘normal’. One may note
                    that this is not altogether different from what
                    a player playing a classic sport undergoes.
                    There’s a lot about my time with DotA
                    that has made me question my place in the
                    gaming community. It’s a toxic environment
                    often, and there have been points where
                    it really does feel just like being a rat
                    fighting another rat for a go on the ‘treat’
                    button. Despite this, the mass appeal of
                    serious competition-of games as sports, as
                    collectively owned hobbies that you engage
                    in because they test you, gives me faith in
                    gaming as a whole.
                    Wanting to get better at something is
                    a very basic and very human drive, one that
                    is diminished whenever somebody argues
                    that the ‘average’ player just wants to be
                    entertained. The great thing about taking a
                    game seriously is that it proves that attitude
                    wrong; not just in terms of what it says
                    about the games industry, but in terms of
                    what it says about people. People, it turns
                    out, are very good at learning and working
                    hard and, from time to time, at cooperating.
                    DotA is no longer important to me because it
                    represents a performance of personal traits;
                    it’s important to me because it represents a
                    performance of these universal ones.

                    For anyone who’s ever coded or made
                    any project, the above naming convention
                    would be familiar. How many times have we
                    renamed, copied, and edited the same code
                    to implement some new idea or algorithm, or
                    just for the sake of posterity? Is there a more
                    efficient way of doing the same? Adding a
                    new idea or taking a backup, but tracking the
                    changes done to the file, at the same time, by
                    different users? Yes. Using Version Control.
                    Version Control, also known as source
                    control or revision control, is the ability to
                    track changes to files made by different
                    programs/users, preferably with timestamps.
                    Each change is uniquely identifiable, so that
                    the user can revert back to an older version of
                    the file, or branch the code entirely, to make
                    some changes, and if required, merge back
                    with the original code. This is an incredibly
                    useful tool, not only for individuals, but also
                    for collaborative editing, where many users
                    can contribute to a public project by creating
                    their own branches. This is the backbone of
                    open source software.
                    There are many version control tools
                    available like Git, SVN, CVS, Mercurial etc.
                    The most popular and widely used is Git,
                    developed by Linus Torvalds, creator
                    of the Linux kernel. Unlike traditional
                    version control software, which
                    requires a server running the central
                    repository, each Git folder is a fullfledged
                    repository with complete
                    history and full version-tracking capabilities,
                    independent of network access or a central
                    server. You don’t even require internet to
                    make Git work, as long as you have access to
                    the local repository; Git will continue tracking
                    changes. Even if you start working on a
                    different computer, but with the same Git
                    folder, Git will provide the entire file history
                    with every change made. Git is used by a
                    variety of software companies like Yahoo,
                    Quora, Twitter, eBay & Google. It is also
                    the recommended version control system
                    at Amazon and Apple. It can be used by IT
                    and COMPUTER students in their projects. In
                    fact, popular IDEs like IntelliJ, Visual Studio
                    etc. have integrated version control plugins.
                    Production & Electronics students can use
                    SVN to track their projects as SVN is better at
                    handling binary files like SolidWorks designs/
                    Eagle PCB desgins compared to Git.
                    In conclusion, I would like to say that
                    Version Control should be comprehensively
                    taught to all undergrads, as it is increasingly
                    being used by all major software companies.
                    Version control is an essential skill that will
                    help us efficiently write and track a code.

                <div class="english-title">ASTROSAT</div>
                <div>ASTROSAT is the first dedicated Indian
                    astronomy mission aimed at studying
                    distant celestial objects. The mission is
                    capable of performing observations in
                    Ultraviolet (UV), optical, low and high energy
                    X-ray wavebands at the same time. The
                    satellite is planned to be launched on 28th
                    September 2015 by PSLV C-30 to a 650 km
                    near equatorial orbit around the Earth.
                    ASTROSAT carries four X-ray payloads
                    (Scientific Instruments), one UV telescope and
                    a charge article monitor. Apart from ISRO, four
                    other Indian institutions, viz., Tata Institute of
                    Fundamental Research TIFR), Indian Institute
                    of Astrophysics (IIA), Inter-University Centre
                    for Astronomy and Astrophysics (IUCAA) and
                    Raman Research Institute (RRI) are involved
                    in payload development.
                    ASTROSAT will carry five astronomy payloads
                    for simultaneous multi-band observations:
                    1. Twin 40-cm Ultraviolet Imaging Telescopes
                    (UVIT) covering Far-UV to optical bands.
                    2. Three units of Large Area X-Ray Proportional
                    Counters (LAXPC) covering medium energy
                    X-rays from 3 to 80 keV with an effective area
                    of 6000 sq.cm. at 10 keV.
                    3. A Soft X-ray Telescope (SXT) with conical
                    foil mirrors and X-ray CCD detector, covering
                    the energy range 0.3-8 keV. The effective
                    area will be about 120 sq.cm. at 1 keV.
                    4. A Cadmium-Zinc-Telluride coded-mask
                    imager (CZTI), covering hard X-rays from 10
                    to 150 keV, with about 10 deg field of view
                    and 500 sq.cm. effective area.
                    5. A Scanning Sky Monitor (SSM)
                    consisting of three one-dimensional
                    position-sensitive proportional counters
                    with coded masks. The assembly will be
                    placed on a rotating platform to scan the
                    available sky once every six hours in order to
                    locate transient X-ray sources.
                    ASTROSAT will be a proposal-driven general
                    purpose observatory, with main scientific
                    focus on:
                    1. Simultaneous multi-wavelength monitoring
                    of intensity variations in a broad range of
                    cosmic sources.
                    2. Monitoring the X-ray sky for new transients.
                    3. Sky surveys in the hard X-ray and UV bands.
                    4. Broadband spectroscopic studies of X-ray
                    binaries, AGN, SNRs, clusters of galaxies and
                    stellar coronae.
                    5. Studies of periodic and non-periodic
                    variability of X-ray sources.
                    Proposal-driven means anyone can
                    submit their proposal for observation of
                    interested sources, QPO, transients, black
                    hole, Clusters using interested payload
                    at any inclination in any orbit on any day.
                    Depending on the excellence of the proposal
                    it will be accepted or rejected by the science
                    committee.
                    Payloads (scientific Instruments
                    mounted on satellite deck) needs to undergo
                    several environmental qualification tests at
                    various test facilities. The level of tests is
                    pre-determined by QA officer after analysing
                    payloads maximum operating range and
                    environmental parameters of mission. Tests
                    carried out are:
                    1. Vibration Test: Vibration tests are carried
                    out to determine that designed system can
                    withstand rigors of vibrations in its intended
                    use environment. Tests carried out in
                    Vibration Lab are of much higher level than
                    the vibrations actually felt during the rocket
                    launch. Vibration tests are carried out in three
                    mechanical axes X-Axis, Y-Axis and Z-Axis .
                    Payload is mounted on mechanical structure
                    which is mounted on Vibration Table.
                    Accelerometers and sensors are used to
                    determine payloads vibration characteristics.
                    2. Thermovac Test: Thermovac test
                    demonstrate performance and survival under
                    temperature variations in vacuum condition,
                    which exceed predicted flight temperature
                    levels. Thermovac test is done immediately
                    after vibration test.
                    Payload needs to perform as per their design
                    in span of short and long Hot and Cold cycles
                    continuously in hard vacuum state. For e.g. If
                    a payloads operating range in Space is from
                    10° to 30° the Thermovac test performed will
                    have five short cycles of 2hrs each ranging
                    from -5 ° to 40 ° and two long cycles of 24hrs
                    soak at -5 ° and 40 ° temperature as per QA
                    guidance.
                    3. EMI/EMC Test: EMI/EMC stands
                    for Electromagnetic Interference and
                    Electromagnetic conductance. The EMI/EMC
                    test ensures that the total payload performs
                    its intended functions when operating in the
                    predicted electromagnetic environment.
                    The test regime is composed of a variety
                    of conducted and radiated emissions, as
                    well as susceptibility tests with both
                    being steady-state and transient
                    in nature. EMI/EMC tests ensure
                    that payloads are compatible
                    with itself, electronic noise
                    emissions, self-generated
                    RF transmissions from antennas, and cross
                    coupling of electrical currents.
                    4. Calibration: All the Payloads in the satellite
                    are scientifically designed, so they need to
                    be calibrated with X-Ray Sources like Am241,
                    Fe55, Cd109... available at ground in-order
                    to set reference data set.
                    After qualifying all the tests payloads
                    undergo Baking and then they are cleared for
                    mounting on satellite deck. Baking is done
                    in Thermovac chamber at a fix temperature
                    to minimise contamination and outgasing.
                    Baking is a passive test and no live tests are
                    performed during baking. Witness mirrors
                    are used to determine contamination level of
                    package.
                    Satellite Assembly: Satellite assembly
                    is done in AIT (Assembly, Integration and
                    Testing) Room. AIT is a big clean room where
                    a low level of environmental pollutants such
                    as dust, airborne microbes, aerosol particles,
                    and chemical vapours are present.
                    Satellite Assembly Testing is carried in three
                    phases in AIT room:
                    Open End Testing: In this phase the initial
                    harnessing (Wiring) is verified and it is
                    assured that NO shorting exists between
                    any two wires. Harnessing is done as per
                    EID (Electrical Instrument Document) and
                    commands are issued and their levels are
                    measured on CRO.
                    Close End Testing: Once open end testing is
                    found satisfactory harnesses are connected
                    to their respective packages (as per
                    their tagging) and close end testing of
                    packages is performed to check for
                    any variations in any electrical and
                    science parameters.
                    After clearance from
                    all Payloads and Packages
                    (Packages are common electronic
                    units for all satellites viz. BMU, BDR,
                    Antennas,
                    Power subsystem...) full level satellite
                    mounting is carried out. Satellite mounting
                    is done panel by panel. Once all panels are
                    mounted satellite is cleared for full level
                    satellite assembly testing. Thermal blankets
                    are mounted as per thermal
                    requirement. Thermal Blanket provides
                    package with desired thermal level for
                    operation.
                    Full Satellite Assembly Testing: In this
                    testing phase all payloads and packages are
                    turned ON together as they are designed
                    to perform in space and checks are done
                    for any anomalies in commands issued, data
                    reception, electrical and science parameters
                    of Payloads and Packages.
                    Full level assembled satellite undergoes EMIEMC
                    test, Thermovac test, Vibration and
                    Acoustic tests before shipment to Sriharikota.
                    Astrosat Satellite was mounted on
                    fourth stage PSLV rocket C-30. PSLV stands
                    for The Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle. The
                    satellite is launched on 28th September 2015
                    by PSLV C-30 to a 650 km near equatorial
                    orbit around the Earth. Rockets are named D
                    in initial stages e.g. PSLV D1 where D stands
                    for Development. Once their performance
                    is satisfactory it is renamed as C indicating
                    Commercial e.g. PSLV C-30.
                    On the PSLV first stage thrust is
                    augmented by six strap-on solid boosters.
                    Four boosters are ground-lit and the
                    remaining two ignite 25 seconds after launch.
                    In the standard PSLV, each booster carries
                    nine tonnes of propellant and produces
                    510 kN thrust. The PSLV has four
                    stages using solid and liquid propulsion
                    systems alternately. Vikas engine built by
                    Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO)
                    is used in the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle
                    (PSLV) and the Geosynchronous Satellite
                    Launch Vehicle (GSLV) series. The engine is
                    used as the second stage of both the PSLV
                    and the GSLV launch vehicles, with four
                    strap-on boosters. The satellite is injected
                    and parked in the Final stage.

                <div class="english-title">220 TB IN THE PALM OF YOUR HAND</div>
                <div>The future of data storage is a pretty
                    ironic problem. Huge amounts of data is
                    generated each day by people, we’re yet to
                    find a way to preserve this deluge of data that
                    works better than the cave man approach of
                    carving messages onto walls.
                    When you’re talking about hundreds,
                    thousands, or millions of years, the shelf-life
                    of our personal data is a mere flash. Current
                    data storage methods don’t last beyond
                    a few decades, which have storage media
                    users worried about the integrity of their
                    data. To solve this, scientists are working on a
                    method to store data cheaply and reliably for
                    the long haul. All research has led to only one
                    conclusion, the best method for backing up
                    and archiving the information superhighway
                    is old-school, nearly antiquated magnetic
                    tape. Yup, your old cassettes and VHS tapes
                    are coming back.
                    Extracting data from a tape is about
                    four times as fast as reading from a hard disk
                    ... The second advantage is reliability. When
                    a tape snaps, it can be spliced back together.
                    The loss is rarely more than a few hundred
                    megabytes. When a terabyte hard disk fails,
                    by contrast, all the data on it may be lost.
                    The third benefit of tapes is that they do not
                    need power to preserve data held on them. It
                    is cheaper than disks, and lasts longer. Tapes
                    can still be read reliably after three decades,
                    against five years for disks. Sony released
                    a 185 terabyte magnetic tape drive for
                    consumers in 2014 while IBM announced that
                    they have figured out a way to have a 220
                    terabyte magnetic tape drive, all this while
                    maintaining a compact size. So why not use it
                    instead of hard disks or solid state drives you
                    ask?
                    Well the downside of magnetic
                    tape drives is their slow access times since
                    accessing a particular data on it means
                    winding the tape compared to hard drives or
                    solid state drives. This is the reason magnetic
                    tape drives are used only to store ‘cold
                    data’ i.e. data which isn’t accessed a lot like
                    backups.
                    So the next time you buy storage remember
                    these until storage technology advances:
                    Reliability + Maximum storage = Magnetic
                    tape drives
                    Value for money = Hard Disk Drive
                    High data transfer speed = Solid State
                    Drive
                    Getting back to long-term data
                    storage, researchers working on
                    the Human Document Project
                    are experimenting with
                    preserving data via QR
                    codes etched into
                    tungsten, coated in silicon nitride. With
                    a similar target, Japanese researchers
                    developed a prototype of a system that uses
                    quartz crystal that they claim can preserve
                    data for 300 million years.
                    To a certain extent all this will help
                    future generations know much more about
                    the current generation than we know about
                    our past. Long term storage is the only way
                    the technology driven world we live in keeps
                    moving forward…

                <div class="english-title">COMPRESSED AIR CAR</div>
                <div>Work on compressed air engine
                    started in 1979. French scientist, Guy Negre,
                    developed compressed air 4-cyclinder
                    engine, for cars, that could run on both air
                    and gasoline, in 1988. Since then, many
                    modifications and changes have been
                    made to improvise on its efficiency and
                    performance. Compressed air car is one of
                    the best innovations that can serve as an
                    alternate for fuel, for the future, causing no
                    pollution.
                    Compressed air car works on the principle
                    of compressed air to drive its mo-tors. It can
                    either be powered solely with air or it can be
                    combined with gasoline, diesel or electrical
                    plant. Engines powered by compressed air
                    drives the piston us-ing the expansion of
                    compressed air rather than ignited air-fuel
                    mixture. The ve-hicle’s accelerator operates
                    a valve on the tank which allows the
                    compressed air to flow into the engine,
                    where the pressure of air’s expansion
                    pushes the pistons and thereby
                    turns the crank shaft. This will
                    produce enough power
                    for speed of 56kmph.
                    When the car surpasses that
                    speed, a motor will operate the
                    in-car compressor so it can compress
                    more air and provide extra power to
                    the engine. The air heats up as it hits the
                    engine, increasing its volume, allowing the
                    car to move faster. These storage tanks are
                    made up of rigid and robust materials like
                    Carbon fiber which helps reduce weight; if
                    penetrated Carbon fiber will crack but won’t
                    produce shrapnel. These tanks can sustain
                    air pressure up to 4500 psi, mak-ing them
                    comparable to steel tanks. Compressed
                    air cars are emission free at the exhaust as
                    electricity is usually the source of energy. It
                    also depends on how clean is this source of
                    electricity.
                    Availability of the source is not an
                    issue as air is a natural resource and is freely
                    available in the atmosphere and can be stored
                    at desired pressure. The list of ad-vantages
                    for compressed air car engine seems to be
                    never ending.
                    Air is renewable energy, it can
                    replace gasoline and diesel, it can reduce
                    global warming gas emission, it is non toxic
                    and environmental friendly, are some of
                    its advantages. It also reduces the overall
                    production cost as it does not require spark
                    plugs, starter motor and a cooling system. It
                    does have its own disadvantages but they are
                    overshadowed by the more than satisfying
                    results it helps to achieve.
                    In conclusion, compressed air car is the
                    next future and the best alternate to the
                    fossil fuel driven engines.

                    COMMUNICATION
                </div>
                <div>In the LLECLAIR, ÉCLAIR protocol
                    works on the sender and receiver extreme
                    ends it does the job of combining two or
                    more layers and implements the cross layer
                    design method. In between sender and
                    receiver LLCLAMP protocols plays a major
                    role of sending and receiving of the data.
                    The proposed protocol exhibits the similar
                    way of communication as LLCLAMP does
                    .i.e., the acknowledgement at the receiver
                    is suppressed and is generated at the base
                    station. The congestion measure is also
                    calculated at the base station and is attached
                    with the acknowledgement.
                    Initially the layer which are to be used
                    for providing the communication are decided
                    by the user then once it has been selected at
                    the sender and receiver’s end this layers are
                    merge using the ÉCLAIR protocol . ÉCLAIR
                    provides an efficient mechanism to merge
                    two or more layers. Tuning Layer provides
                    flexibility for the connection between two or
                    more layers. The purpose of the tuning layer
                    is to provide a interface in order to attach
                    layers (actually the functionalities of layers).
                    The optimizing subsystem contains the
                    algorithms and data structures for cross layer
                    optimizations. It is the cross layer engine.
                    The OSS contains many Protocol Optimizers
                    (POs). A PO contains the algorithm for a given
                    cross layer optimization. The OSS executes
                    concurrently with the existing protocol stack
                    and does not increase the stack processing
                    overhead.
                    The design of ECLAIR enables easy
                    deployment and control of cross layer
                    feedback optimizations, enables interaction
                    among multiple protocol stacks and facilitates
                    user feedback.
                    - Event Notification: The TLs provide the
                    facility for POs to register for interesting
                    events at a layer.
                    - Switch on/off : Since the cross layer system
                    is separate, it can be easily/dynamically
                    switched on or off. Also, individual POs may
                    be switched on/off.
                    - Guards: The TLs may implement guards to
                    ensure that a PO does not grossly deviate
                    from the expected protocol behaviour.
                    - Seamless mobility: ECLAIR can be used
                    to enable seamless mobility on the mobile
                    devices through POs that can monitor and
                    control multiple protocol stacks.
                    - User Tuning Layer: Besides the layer
                    specific TLs, ECLAIR also has a User
                    Tuning Layer (UTL). UTL allows a
                    device user or an external entity
                    e.g.: a distributed algorithm
                    or a base station, to tune
                    the device behaviour.
                    Once the Layers are merged that
                    is the cross layer environment is been
                    created using the ÉCLAIR protocol then the
                    LLCLMAP approach is used for performing
                    the communication. The L2CLAMP agent
                    module in the figure suppresses the outgoing
                    L2CLAMP -TCP ACKs at the receiver side and
                    generates them locally at the sender or base
                    station. The basic idea behind approach is to
                    shift TCP ACK generation point from mobile
                    receiver to the base station. L2CLAMP -
                    TCP requires implementation of a software
                    module, called L2CLAMP agent, inside BS /
                    AP protocol stack above the link layer. The
                    L2CLAMP agent sniffs the ingress traffic
                    from the fixed network assuming to have
                    access to the network and transport layer
                    headers. Whenever a TCP data packet
                    is detected, the L2CLAMP Agent
                    in the BS / AP, performs service
                    rate, congestion measurement,
                    received rate and calculates
                    the AWND value, stores flow-related information such
                    as flow sequence number carried
                    by the packet, port numbers, ACK
                    flag and ACK sequence number, along
                    with the AWND value. L2CLAMP agent
                    calculates the desired size of the AWND
                    window based on the values of congestion
                    measure, received rate and RTT.
                    Finally the overall flow can be shown as

                <div>Our fingers are the most versatile
                    tools we possess. The ability to use
                    opposable thumbs to grasp objects and
                    precisely control each finger for fine work, is
                    still unmatched by any known species or even
                    machines. Our fingertips possess the highest
                    concentration of touch receptors, making
                    it extremely sensitive to pressure, vibration
                    and texture. Technology has made ample
                    use of this ability with knobs, tactile buttons,
                    touchscreens etc. But the interfaces still seem
                    unintuitive. Imagine being able to increase the
                    volume of your smarphone by just twiddling
                    your fingers? This is exactly what Google’s
                    Advanced Technology & Projects (ATAP) aims
                    to do, with their innovative Project Soli.
                    Project Soli aims at creating an
                    interaction sensor which can track minute
                    motions at high speed & accurately using
                    radar. It can be fabricated into a very small
                    integrated chip and can be embedded
                    into everyday consumer electronics like
                    smartphones. It works very much like a
                    traditional radar design, it emits radio waves
                    directed towards an object and the reflected
                    waves are processed to calculate the position
                    & velocity of the object in 3D space. However,
                    the Soli sensor is designed to track objects in
                    a narrow region, but with very high degree of
                    accuracy. This was achieved by using Google’s
                    indigenously developed Gesture Recognition
                    Pipeline, where each stage is designed to
                    extract specific gesture information from
                    the received signals. Traditional finger
                    tracking systems making use of either image
                    processing or tracking markers suffer from
                    many problems such as varying lighting
                    conditions, object interference. But radar can propagate through metal too, making it
                    easier to embed the Soli sensor in everyday
                    objects. Google has pushed the limit on the
                    digital processing capabilities of today’s
                    processors to accurately track the finger at
                    sub millimetre range. Google is now putting
                    together an alpha version developer kit &
                    a software API of the Soli sensor. A select
                    group of developers will be provided this kit
                    to create new interactions and applications.
                    Once the alpha and beta stage testing is
                    done, the sensor will be released to OEMs to
                    include it in their products.
                    Project Soli heralds a new era of
                    gesture controlled computing. Combined
                    with other Google ATAP projects like Tango
                    (Augmented Reality) & Jacquard (Electronic
                    Fabrics), Google aims to revolutionize the
                    human machine interaction technology with
                    smarter & natural gesture recognition. The
                    future is indeed here, within our fingertips.

                <div class="english-title">THE GOOD SIDE OF COPYING: STORY OF TWO FORGOTTEN ENTREPRENEURS</div>
                <div>It was October 1938, in a rented room
                    above a bar in New York. Chestor Carlson was
                    striving to achieve some significant results on
                    his experiments. This struggle of his would
                    soon revolutionize the world.
                    His assistant Otto had a freshly
                    prepared sulphur coating on a zinc plate.
                    On a glass slide Otto wrote the date
                    and the place ‘10-22-38 ASTORIA’
                    using Indian ink. Then with a
                    handkerchief he rubbed the
                    zinc coated plate to apply an
                    electrostatic charge and
                    placed the glass slide over it. Chestor and his
                    assistant shut the windows to make the room
                    as dark as possible and put the combination
                    under a bright incandescent lamp for a
                    few seconds. The slide was taken out and
                    some lycopodium powder was sprinkled
                    over it. By gently blowing on the surface
                    the lose powder was removed and what
                    remained was a near perfect photocopy of
                    the notation ‘10-22-38 ASTORIA’. It was this
                    day that photoelectrography, later known as
                    Xerography or simply Xerox, was invented.
                    Here is the science behind the process.
                    When Otto rubbed the zinc coated sulphur
                    surface with a handkerchief, it induced a
                    positive electric charge on the plate. When
                    the surface was covered with the glass slide
                    and exposed to light, only the positive charges
                    under the ink stayed while the rest got drained
                    (due to photoconductivity). Lycpodium
                    powder consists of negatively charged
                    particles which when sprinkled on the surface
                    adhered to the positively charged area. After
                    blowing, the excess powder was removed
                    and only an image of the print remained.
                    Even though Carlson believed that an
                    office copier could have a remarkable impact
                    on our daily lives, the xerox machine was an
                    innovation that no one wanted back then.
                    Not a single company was willing to invest
                    in his idea. And we were heading towards a
                    world where documentation processes would
                    take ages, engineers would never finish their
                    submissions and stationary shops would
                    never make the kind of profit they do.
                    Finally, after six years a non-profit
                    research organization called Battelle showed
                    some interest. However, things remained
                    sluggish since Battele wasn’t strongly
                    convinced that the product would
                    have a bright future.
                    At the same time,
                    Haloid, a company that manufactured photographic paper had been running into losses after the Second
                    World War. Its revenues were increasing and its earnings were shrinking. Joseph C. Wilson who was
                    leading Haloid at that time believed that the company’s revival depended on profit, profit depended
                    on growth and growth would come with new innovations. Haloid took up Clarkson’s idea and decided to
                    develop it after an agreement with Batelle. For Wilson and his organization this was a big gamble.
                    Investing in a new project when the company was already heading towards a crisis had made it a do or
                    die situation for them.
                    In 1959, twenty one years after Chestor Carlson had developed xerography, Haloid introduced the
                    first convenient office copier. This new technology dramatically altered the industry and started
                    spinning profits for Haloid which was renamed Xerox.
                    Today Xerox is a company with 130,000 employees and 12,000 active patents. Inventions at Xerox Paulo
                    Alto Research Centre (PARC) include the laser printer, Ethernet, computer mouse and many more. The
                    company has spread into fields such as robotics and automation, healthcare, information technology
                    and banking. But only a few know that Xerox is an inspiring story of two forgotten entrepreneurs who
                    had the courage to take the path less travelled and a relentless belief in their purpose.

                <div>Imagine a shopping scenario, where in the market, goods introduce themselves. This wouldn’t sound
                    hypothetical after knowing that back in 2008, the number of things connected to the internet were
                    greater than the people living on Earth. By 2020, the number of living things connected to the
                    internet will be about 50 billion and thus comes into picture, IoT –Internet of Things.
                    Internet of Things includes a number of technologies and research disciplines that enable the
                    internet to reach out to the real world of physical objects.
                    IoT, also known as the Internet of Objects, refers to a wireless network between objects, which are
                    self configuring such as household appliances.
                    What’s more fascinating than the idea that from anytime, anyplace and connectivity for anyone, we
                    will now have connectivity for anything. IoT basically revolves around the three A’s.
                    A: Anytime Connection. A: Anyplace Connection. A: Anything Connection.
                    Ambient intelligence, flexible structures, event driven, complex access technologies and semantic
                    sharing are some of its characteristics. In technical terms, IoT helps us to achieve:
                    • Flexible Configuration.
                    • Universal Transport and Internetworking.
                    • Accessibility and Usability.
                    • Acts as Technology Integrator
                    The basic aim of IoT is to develop a communication between physical world and information world.
                    The IoT Model is made up of Five Layers:
                    • Semantic & Cognitive Computing: Semantic analysis allows you to use artificial intelligence to
                    extract value from your data instead of making only simple predictions.
                    • Forensics and Analytics: Provide intelligence that is beyond simply responding to or conveying an
                    event. Use the collective past to statistically map the future, increasing the ROI from your
                    solution.
                    • Interpret and React: Leverage data from the normalization engine to create business rules,
                    establishing how the system responds at an event level.
                    • Normalization & Engine: Transform data from assets to a common format. This feature enables the
                    sophisticated functionality provided within the subsequent layers.
                    • Connect and Communicate: Enable features such as guaranteed delivery, encryption, chunking and
                    communications format and the communications bridge using any carrier or network.
                    Internet of Things, cloud computing and services are all aspects of a future internet, strength of
                    each CAN AND SHOULD BE COMBINED!
                    But we are definitely at the beginning of an interesting journey.

                <div class="english-title">WHERE IS YIFY?</div>
                <div>Last year in mid-October, popular movie release group YIFY’s website became unresponsive. For what
                    torrent aficionados thought it was a temporary issue, YIFY was gone for good. The unexpected
                    shutdown marked the end of an era that started at the turn of the decade.
                    YIFY was a Scene group that emerged in the early 2010s when the X264 codec started to gain
                    significant popularity.A Scene group is an underground community of people who specialize in
                    distribution of copyrighted material like TV shows, movies, music, etc. X264 is an open source
                    software which is used to convert videos. Ease of use, and the cornucopia of settings and options it
                    offers makes it a winner amongst other softwares. It is the most widely used codec for mobile
                    devices. The group members were quite deft in using the new X264 codec which gave surprisingly
                    decent file sizes for higher frame sizes on videos. This meant that they can compress a 720p movie
                    into a very low size of 700 megabytes. A movie compressed into 700 MB using an X264 codec will be
                    more visually appealing than compressing a movie to the same size using an XVID codec. Low size
                    means low bit-rate and XVID simply can’t perform well at low bit-rates. This is one of the biggest
                    reasons for YIFY’s popularity.YIFY waits for the movie to be available in Blu-ray versions because
                    using the Blu-ray as a source for conversion gives the best results. Others either release a theatre
                    shoot version or leak a screener copy of the movie which often have very low resolution hence not
                    too appeasing to viewers. Screener copy is that copy which the film maker shares with the censor
                    board or the Awards Jury for evaluation. Pirates often get access to such exclusive stuffs through
                    their connections
                    with industry insiders.
                    Who took YIFI down and how?
                    What is YIFI doing right now?
                    Online piracy is like digital theft.
                    But unlike the conventional theft, there
                    is no police or government organization
                    involved in investigations. So it becomes the
                    responsibility of the film-makers to identify
                    pirates and drag them to court. People
                    involved in online piracy are difficult to trace
                    when there are millions of users sharing pieces
                    of the entire movie. The users and groups
                    involved often belong to different countries
                    around the globe. Because of these reasons,
                    movie industries around the world have
                    organizations, who watch over the internet
                    to curb piracy. Motion Picture Association of
                    America (MPAA) is one such prominent and
                    influential organization which is a group of six
                    of the biggest movie studios of Hollywood.
                    Hollywood spends considerable amount
                    of its film earnings on efforts to kill piracy.
                    The MPAA identifies individuals or groups
                    involved in piracy and files lawsuits on the
                    grounds of copyright theft. Lawsuits are
                    often expensive and time consuming even
                    in the United States. The losses occurred by
                    the film-makers due to piracy is in millions,
                    but the money gained from settlements
                    and damage claims are minimal because the
                    scene groups and individuals are not that
                    rich to give millions. And hence we don’t see
                    many cases of torrent site and release groups
                    getting arrested. It is just a waste of time for
                    the movie industry.
                    YIFY was around the Scene for many
                    years and no doubt it was on MPAA’s radar, but
                    to trace a group like YIFY is not an easy task.
                    Scene groups leave little or no information
                    about their location or personal details in
                    the open. They use Virtual Private
                    Networks (VPN) to hide their identity on
                    the internet, Internet Relay Chat (IRC) to
                    communicate with fellow pirates and high
                    security FTP servers to share files within the
                    community to process them. They use bots to
                    upload torrents onto the Bittorrent trackers
                    like PublicHD, KickassTorrents, 1337x, The
                    Pirate Bay, and ExtraTorrent.They seed their
                    files onto the Bittorrent networks using
                    dedicated Seedboxes which are situated in
                    a country different from theirs. A seedbox
                    is BitTorrent jargon for a dedicated highspeed
                    server, used exclusively for torrent
                    transfers. This means that the members of
                    the group do not use their private computers
                    to share their files, which keeps their own
                    identity safe. However the group couldn’t
                    stay anonymous for long until October last
                    year when the MPAA cracked down onto the
                    operator of YIFY’s official website YTS.to who
                    happens to be a resident of New Zealand.
                    MPAA is not a government organization and
                    if it wants to take action on YIFY’s operator,
                    it has to proceed to the court. The site was
                    shuttered by a multi-million dollar lawsuit
                    filed in a New Zealand court by the MPAA
                    and the group won’t ever be coming back.
                    YIFY cooperated with the MPAA and settled
                    the matter by exchanging some information.
                    This information will come handy for the
                    MPAA in the future days to come when it
                    cracks down on more pirates. Meanwhile,
                    several imposters make blatant attempts to
                    cash in on the void left by the demise of YIFY,
                    none of them which are as good as YIFY.

                    2015- 2016 began with its installation on 10th April 2015. The planning and preparations for the
                    next semester started soon thereafter. Our Council made an attempt to inspire creativity through
                    innovative, interactive, interesting and informative events. ‘The International Yoga Day’ was the
                    first event of the Students’ Council, when many of the Staff and Students pulled out their yoga mats
                    and took part in the yoga session conducted by Ms Leena Pandit.</p>

                    <p>‘No person is an island’ and hence to foster camaraderie, to add color to the lives of the
                        students in the campus ‘Friendship Day’ was celebrated on 31st July wherein students from
                        various disciplines participated with childlike enthusiasm and played games like scrambled legs,
                        sound game and balloon caterpillar. TE IT emerged as the winners.</p>

                    <p>In an effort to make our First Year colleagues feel at ease we organized a Fresher’s Day on 22nd
                        August. It was a small informal gathering with fun, food and fiesta. Ms. Shreya was crowned the
                        Miss Fresher title and Mr. Atharva bagged the title of Mr. Fresher.</p>

                    <p>I would like to thank every individual colleague of mine at Fr. Conceicao Rodrigues College of
                        Engineering who has co-operated and guided us to make this academic year culturally enriching
                        and successful.</p></div>

                <div><p>The Fr. Conceicao Rodrigues College of Engineering presented the Fr. Conceicao Memorial Debate,
                    a National level inter-collegiate debating event addressing current topics. The 17th edition of the
                    series saw 32 colleges across Maharashtra, Gujarat and Karnataka pit their wits against each other
                    on the 11th and 12th of September 2015 at the Fr. Conceicao Rodrigues College of Engineering,
                    Bandstand, Bandra.</p>

                    <p>This theme for this year was as eloquent as it was harsh. The cruel reality is often covered by
                        the rose bedded lie that is shown to us. A man’s quest for the truth is what inspires him to
                        look beyond the appeasing lie and embrace the reality. Keeping in mind the current scenario, the
                        theme for the 17th edition of the prestigious event was “Appeasing mist shrouding the hills of
                        reality”.</p>

                    <p>The opening ceremony was graced by the founder-director of Chanakya Institute of Public
                        Leadership, Mr. Radhakrishnan Pillai and famous actress and model, Ms. Suchitra Pillai. Both the
                        invitees enchanted the audience with their powerful yet mesmerizing speeches.</p>

                    <p>The competition comprised of 5 rounds (Eliminations, Pre-quarters, Quarters, Semi-finals and
                        Finals) which followed a knockout, non-parliamentary format. The first day witnessed 32 teams
                        battling it out on a variety of topics ranging from socio-economic to political trends gripping
                        the nation to topics concerning the entire world. Marital rape, Technocracy, Vidarbha,
                        Parliamentary canteen subsidies, the non alignment movement were some of the many crucial topics
                        deliberated and discussed upon. After 28 nail-biting and incredible debates, four teams, that
                        is, Fr. Conceicao Rodrigues College of Engineering, Don Bosco Institute of Technology, St.
                        Francis Institute of Technology and Institute of Chemical Technology emerged victorious and made
                        it to the second day.</p>

                    <p>The final day was held in the host college’s state-of-art auditorium “Samvaad”. The topic for the
                        first semi-final between Fr. CRCE and SFIT was ‘Soldiers should be allowed to refuse
                        participation
                        in military actions on the basis of their conscience”. The second semifinal witnessed DBIT
                        battle it out with ICT, on the topic ‘India should actively support the Tibetan Freedom
                        Movement’. Both the semifinal rounds proved to be highly entertaining and amusing and resulted
                        in SFIT and DBIT as the two triumphant teams.</p>

                    <p>The finals witnessed an enthralling and insightful debate in front of a packed Samvaad, which was
                        grilling for the teams and thrilling for the audience. The motion was “Developed countries
                        should integrate war refugees into their society” which was proposed by SFIT and opposed by
                        DBIT. It was judged by Senior Professor, Ms. Nilanjana Gupta, Senior Professor at MMK College
                        and Mr. Mohit Chhabra, working in the Quality assurance lead dept for TCS.</p>

                    <p>Famous journalist and writer, Ms. Shashi Baliga, graced this occasion as the chief guest. She
                        addressed the audience with an enriching speech on debating and the necessity for today’s youth
                        to get themselves involved in the crucial matters of the nation. Amidst a resounding roar of
                        claps, contingent from St. Francis Institute of Technology was declared the winner of the
                        coveted Fr. Conceicao Rodrigues Memorial Debate Rolling Trophy. The team from DBIT was the
                        second best that day and was declared the Runners-up. The best speaker title was awarded to
                        Daniel D’souza.</p>

                    <p>The college will continue to keep this tradition alive in an attempt to encourage today’s youth
                        to think rationally and engage themselves in the more crucial matters of the nation.</p>

                <div><p>On 28th August 2015, the serene and scenic Bandstand immersed itself in a frenzied jollification
                    of technology as Fr. Conceicao Rodrigues college of Engineering celebrated its annual technical
                    festival – Crescendo 2015. The annual one-day inter-college event was born out of the desire to
                    express students’ creativity using technology as the primary tool and to explore and implement all
                    that is learnt in the classrooms in real world application.</p>

                    <p>Just like its name the festival has been getting bigger and better every year. This year the fest
                        had a plethora of events to offer on the platter ranging from technical to non-technical, from
                        challenging to fun-filled ones.</p>

                    <p>Students from across the city came to participate in these technical events and used their
                        technical expertise to solve numerous challenges. One of the technical events was a challenge
                        named Propulsion that asked the participants to make a working prototype of a hovercraft.
                        Junkyard wars (Build a working product by using waste and defunct devices), Defuse the bomb (To
                        comprehend complex electronic circuits to emerge as winners), Techathon (A series of Mechanics
                        tasks) and a host of Coding events – Code Hunt, Game of codes and Codetective were other
                        platforms where students exhibited their technical prowess.</p>

                        and LAN and Console Gaming. The emphasis was also on the social services and general awareness

                        event named – Mumbai Behind the Scenes. There was a street play competition and a presentation
                        by an NGO about Blind faith and black magic which drew in large crowds.</p>

                    <p>The audience was in for a treat as a Car-expo was also the part of the festival. On display were
                        Porsche, Mustang and high-end modified Chevrolet cars. Also the college technical teams
                        demonstrated their products to the assembled visitors including the college made F1 racing
                        car.</p>

                    <p>The day ended on the high note of a quintessential crescendo with winners in various events being
                        awarded certificates, cash prizes and gift vouchers by Buckaroo, Endeavour, StupidSid, Redbull
                        and Thomas Cook among others.</p>

                    <p>Second Half (2015-2016)<br/> The New Year ’16 started with a ‘’continuation of where we left off
                        in 2015. We had an Intra Collegiate Cricket Tournament which was held at Shivaji Park. After a
                        few power packed and enthusiastic afternoons TE COMPUTERS emerged triumphant followed by BE
                        ELECTRONICS. The second week saw the Intra college Throw-ball tournament for girls. Girls from
                        all classes fought with much zeal and energy. SE ELECTRONICS won Gold followed by SE COMPUTERS
                        with Silver. Next we had a Badminton Tournament for girls and boys held at North Indian Gymkhana

                <div class="english-title">Public Relations Report</div>
                <div><p>It is said, “Next to doing the right thing, the most important thing is to let people know you
                    are doing the right thing.” This saying, was definitely the PR motto for the year.</p>

                    <p>Being the PR Head of the Students’ Council for the year 2015-16, has indeed, been an amazing and
                        memorable journey for me. The duty of the PR head is to create enthusiasm and excitement about
                        all the events organised by the council, so as to ensure active participation.</p>

                    <p>We had a mix of Intra-collegiate and Intercollegiate events this year. The odd semester was
                        marked off by the Yoga Day event, inspired by Narendra Modi’s initiative to adopt Yoga in one’s
                        lifestyle, for its numerous benefits. This was a huge success among the youth of our college.
                        The next event was Friendship’s Day where all the 12 classes participated with great zeal and
                        reminisced about the games they used to play in childhood.</p>

                    <p>The first intercollegiate event of the year was our Technical Festival, Crescendo. With the
                        responsibility of keeping up with the overwhelming participation of last year, we invited over
                        40 colleges in Mumbai to take part. At the success of our event, The Times of India newspaper
                        published an article on Crescendo the very next day.</p>

                    <p>Our Mega-event and probably the most awaited event of the year, the Annual Fr. Conceicao
                        Rodrigues Memorial Debate was held on 11th and 12th of September, 2015. In order to make a mark
                        on the students in the Literature and Debating clique, we invited colleges from all over the
                        country. In the end, we had 32 teams representing reputed colleges. The PR process for the same
                        began well in advance for which I would like to thank our Editorial Secretary, Bryceleen
                        D’souza.</p>

                    <p>The Students’ Council also continued with last year’s debut Sports extravaganza ATHLOS, where we
                        invited around 40 colleges across the city and saw them battle it out for the prizes in our
                        events. Another remarkable PR Strategy that we came up with this year was the conception of the
                        Facebook page, HUMANS OF CRCE. Initially thought off as a means to get people to tell us about
                        their Kairos moment, for the magazine FragMag, this page now pens down hidden stories of all
                        CRCEites. This initiative has definitely touched hearts across the campus and will hopefully
                        continue to do so in the years to come.</p>

                    <p>Following the footsteps of our seniors, we will be continuing with Euphoria being a week-long
                        celebration. During the week we shall see over 50 intra-collegiate events along with our dynamic
                        War of Bands and the intercollegiate Dance event, Paridhan. Paridhan this year, will be
                        showcasing the talent of 10 teams from top colleges across the city while, our college will
                        definitely be ‘rocking on’ the music displayed by 8 really energetic bands.</p>

                    <p>In conclusion, it’s important to mention the hard work and dedication of the Junior Council
                        without which the great work done in PR would not have been possible. Also, special thanks to
                        Likita Reddy(Ex- PR Head) for her guidance and advice. And last but not the least, gratitude
                        towards all the members of the Students’ Council for making all the work seem much easier.<br/>
                        Cheers to Council 2015-16!</p>

                <div>With over 100 participating teams in a competition which began with merely 3 participating
                    colleges when founded in 2002, ABU Robocon is one of the most prestigious Robotics
                    competitions in the world. The competition aims to encourage budding engineers and
                    enthusiasts to innovate and create machines for producing desired results.
                    Envisioning a future outside the monotone of academics, students from all the four branches
                    of engineering came together, aspiring to achieve a unified goal of securing the highest rank in
                    the competition. This gave birth to one of the most sought after technical teams in the college.
                    The team consists of production students who design and fabricate the virtually artificial agent.
                    While the electronics, computers and Info. Tech. students automate the robot to meet the
                    requirements stated by the competition. As easy as it seems from the outside, the perfection
                    we strive to achieve comes from long days and short nights, persistent practice, hours of
                    sweat, blood and tears, and settling for nothing but the best. As the problem statement arrives
                    in the month of August, the team spends 3 months prior to that, perfecting concepts and
                    implementing them practically.
                    This year’s theme is “Clean Energy Recharging the world”, designed to create awareness of
                    efficient energy consumption and clean and renewable energy utilization. The mechanism
                    involving the hybrid Robot driving the eco robot went through a series of trial and error, until
                    the most ideal solution was identified. The students, coding and wiring the microcontrollers
                    have worked diligently to ensure that the autonomous eco robot and the hybrid robot are
                    automated efficiently. We thank our faculty in-charge, Prof. Ajay K. for always directing and
                    motivating us. Almost the entire arena has been successfully traversed; and now with a little
                    practice, ‘Chai-Yo’ no longer seems difficult to achieve.

                    beyond the four walls of the classroom, to help them put their theoretical knowledge into
                    practice and become better engineers.
                    The team is currently participating in SAE BAJAINDIA—a national level competition held in
                    Pithampur, Indore. The competition tests our designing, fabricating and manufacturing skills. It
                    has three stages: virtual round, technical inspection and the final round. We cleared the virtual
                    round with an all India rank of 51 out of 400 and also the technical inspection with no glitches.
                    Our ATV weighs roughly 195 KGs, that is 65 KGs lesser than the previous year, which is a great
                    achievement for the entire team. The final competition is on the 16th of February, 2016, for
                    which the team is preparing now.
                    The team participated in the International Series of Karting held in Bangalorelast year. For this
                    competition, it had to design, manufacture and run a Go-Kart. The team stood 7th all over India
                    out of 150 participating teams and was the first team from Maharashtra to clear the Technical
                    Inspection. The team was awarded the “Best Manufacturing Award”. We ranked 3rd in the skid
                    pad test and also 8th in the acceleration test overall.
                    The team has improved substantially and aims to rank amongst the first 10 in the SAE BAJAINDIA
                    2016. These achievements have been possible because of our H.O.D, Prof. D.S. Sudhakar, our
                    ex-faculty advisor Dr. Vijay Bilolikar and our current advisor Prof. Hitendra Vaishnav, who have

                <div>Our mutual passion for automobiles and the zeal to learn, led to the foundation of team Pravega in
                    2012. The team is now known as ‘Formula Racing’.
                    It comprises of over thirty interdisciplinary students, who design, conceptualize, fabricate, test
                    and race
                    a single-seater formula style racecar, which participates in competitions hosted by FSAE. Each team
                    member brings instrumental skills to the team. The union between the diverse skills and strong team
                    work forms the core of our team.
                    The team made its international debut in 2014 at the Formula Student Japan (FSJ) and looks forward
                    to
                    participating in the upcoming SUPRA by SAEINDIA, to be held at the Buddh International Circuit,

                    --Eddie Rickenbacker<br/>
                    In Team Vaayushastra we understand first-hand, the correlation between the will to achieve and
                    success.
                    We are 12 young minds, passionate about aeronautics. With four branches working
                    simultaneously, we design, model and fabricate the Unmanned Aerial Vehicle set to soar the
                    American skies in the SAE Aero Design Competition.
                    The competition consists of three classes: Regular, Micro and Advanced; our team participates
                    in the advanced class. The problem statement involves successful deployment of a humanitarian
                    package onto a specified location and height, which is kept in check using the Data Acquisition
                    System and User Interface. Since its debut in 2013, Team Vaayushastra has always finished in the
                    top 10. And it placed 1st globally last year in the technical presentation.
                    The challenge now is to excel in this field with efficient use of materials as well as skillful
                    fabrication to reduce the margin of gross errors of the design parameters. This year has been a
                    huge learning curve and has boosted the team’s practical knowledge.
                    The guidance of Prof. D.S. Sudhakar, HOD-Production and the support of all the other HODs
                    have been imperative in the growth of the Aerial journey of Fr. CRCE.
                    The invaluable experience of the last three years, especially our overall stunning performance
                    last year, has encouraged us to use a similar fuselage, with a few modifications to the engine
                    mount (keeping in mind the CG balance). And to use slightly larger rectangular wings as
                    opposed to elliptical. We hope to perform even better this year in keeping with last years’
                    philosophy of working in silence and letting our victories speak for themselves. We are all set to

                <div>The Government of India mandates that all doctors must serve 3 years of rural service on conclusion
                    of their five and a half year training. However with a doctor to patient ratio of 0.7 doctors per
                    1000 Indians, it isn’t enough.
                    Team Mavericks UAS, under the guidance of Prof. D.S.S. Sudhakar aims to bridge this divide using
                    unmanned aerial vehicles to pick up tests and deliver prescriptions, connecting doctors in urban
                    facilities to the vast and dispersed rural population.
                    Over the past year we’ve gathered together a team of engineers dedicated to realizing this dream. We
                    closed the year with a manufacturing partnership with the Godrej Innovation Center and kicked 2016
                    off with a mentorship and support program from PCDFire.
                    To help us focus our efforts we have enrolled in the 2016 UAV Outback Challenge.
                    The UAV Challenge— Outback Rescue is a bi-annual competition for the development of unmanned aerial
                    vehicles sponsored by the Government of Australia and is conducted in the vast Australian Outback.
                    The competition features an open challenge for all aviation enthusiasts—adults and high-school
                    students. The event is aimed at promoting the civilian use of unmanned aerial vehicles and the
                    development of low-cost systems that could be used for search and rescue missions. It is one of the
                    largest robotics challenges in the world.
                    It is with great pleasure that we announce that the team is among the only 56 teams globally to have
                    successfully passed the first stage of the competition – Deliverable One (D1). The team looks
                    forward to submitting its second Deliverable (D2) and eventually participating in the Challenge
                    Finale in September 2016!

                <div>Established in 2014, with the help and support of Prof. Kranti Wagle, IEEE-PROJECT CELL is an
                    endeavor to promote innovative thinking in young minds. We work towards accomplishing tasks that can
                    be gradually developed on a large scale and solve many social problems that exist today. At Project
                    Cell, we tread towards learning new concepts, techniques and gaining practical experiences on
                    implementation of creative ideas.
                    This year, the council organized an image processing workshop for the second year students
                    (Computers, IT, Electronics) of the college. The concepts of digital image, gray scale,
                    thresholding, masking and contours were taught. The students were also guided into implementing a
                    mini project of object tracking on the lines of the mentioned concepts.
                    Current projects of the team include:
                    A) E-YANTRA 2015-16
                    Our team is working on the implementation of the theme “Hazardous Waste Disposal” that attempts to
                    automate a system to segregate and transport hazardous waste to their designated locations.
                    A robot is being programmed to identify and transfer these wastes to an isolated area travelling
                    across a mechanical bridge.
                    B) CRCE SOLAR
                    Aim: To establish a solar grid in our college.
                    Phase 1: We have successfully developed a prototype for harnessing solar energy to light DC street
                    lamps.
                    Phase 2: To set up a Solar rooftop in CRCE, with an inverter and grid connection.
                    Future Initiatives:
                    Expansion of CRCE SOLAR by the addition of smart grid technology, solar trackers, data loggers, etc.
                    CRCE Windmill: Utilize the ample wind energy in college, with similar green energy aims but with
                    more diverse technology.
                    Effectively utilize the infrastructure and robotics facilities already available in college.
                    Make a Project Database i.e. create a database of all the projects developed at Project Cell and
                    other curriculum projects, making them easily available to professors and students in the future.

                <div><p><i>“Humans are mortal. So are ideas. An idea needs propagation as much as a plant needs
                    watering. Otherwise both will wither and die.”</i>
                    ― -B.R. Ambedkar</p>
                    On the 11th of April, 2015, Fr. Conceicao Rodrigues College of Engineering had the
                    privilege of hosting its maiden TEDx event. TEDxCRCE marked the advent of the TEDx movement
                    in our college and was the first TEDx event to be hosted by any engineering college under the
                    Mumbai University. As opposed to a usually sultry mid-April afternoon, the atmosphere at our
                    venue was electric and full of energy. TEDxCRCE saw 250 (simulcast and live) attendees and
                    11 speakers come together to celebrate the endless possibilities that originate as a result of
                    innovative ideas, and explore “The Unbounded Panorama”- which was the theme of our event.
                    The event saw many great personalities like D.Sivanandhan, Ex-DGP, Mumbai Police;
                    Kalpana Morparia, CEO India JP Morgan Chase; Dr. Radhakrishnan Pillai, Best-selling author
                    and Management Guru; Anuradha Prabhudesai, Founder of Lakshaya Foundation, and others,
                    share their thought provoking opinions. The event also saw Kanchan Daniel and the Beards,
                    a renowned Blues band croon some famous numbers and a mesmerizing, soulful violin
                    performance by international artist Karthick Iyer that left everybody spellbound.
                    Cumulating the spirit of TED’s mission—“Ideas Worth Spreading” and our college
                    motto—“Moulding Engineers who can build the Nation”, TEDxCRCE strived to recreate the
                    unique experience found at TED, where the world’s leading thinkers and doers congregate
                    to share what they are most passionate about. Our aim was to provide a platform where the
                    smartest thinkers, greatest visionaries, and most fascinating teachers would be inspired and get
                    the opportunity to inspire others.
                    Encouraged immensely by the bountiful appreciation received for the first event, we
                    organized multiple TEDx Salon events to keep our college community inspired between
                    successive main events.
                    On the 5th of September 2015, The TEDxCRCE council organized its first ever edition
                    of TEDx Salon events. The event was witnessed by over 200 attendees including first year
                    engineering students, faculty members and the college management. “Thriving in Engineering
                    and Beyond” was the theme that bolstered dialogue between the new entrants and our very
                    own alumni, who guided them on various aspects of college.
                    The second edition of TEDx Salon event was on 3rd October, 2015. This event was
                    witnessed by around 150 attendees including our college students, faculty members and
                    college management. “New Dimensions“, was the theme set up for this event with speakers
                    like Paresh Shetty, President Idea Cellular; HIV activist Jyoti Dhawale; Forum for the Future
                    Director, Anna Warrington share their views, followed by an energetic singing performance by
                    YouTube sensation Shraddha Sharma.
                    TEDxCRCE firmly believes in offering various platforms for community based idea
                    sharing. Keeping this in mind, we organized a one-day trek to the majestic Korigad fort, where
                    students shared their experiences on what connected them with nature.
                    We extend our gratitude to Prof. D.S. Sudhakar, Prof. Deblina Saha, and Prof. Anusha
                    Jayasimha for their invaluable support in all our endeavors.
                    In the past, TEDxCRCE has organized multiple knowledge and entertainment based
                    events like quizzes, a C seminar and a widely appreciated obstacle based football event—“Kick
                    me”, during our college technical fest, Crescendo. This year too, we wish to raise the bar by
                    organizing events that bolster our motive of community centric learning and foster cumulative
                    idea sharing, thereby supplanting all expectations.

                <div class="english-title">CSI</div>
                <div>‘CSI’ or the Computer Society of India is the first and the largest body of computer professionals
                    in
                    India. Starting its journey in 1965, it has now grown to be a national non-profit body representing
                    computer professionals, exchanging views, ideas and information to learn and share. As a result
                    of similar seeds sown, the CSI-CRCE chapter emerged. It continues to get nourished by young
                    bright minds and in turn paves the way for our upcoming bright youth.
                    Our ulterior motive is to propagate something the students can’t gain from just their course
                    syllabi – Practical Knowledge, thereby make them Industry-ready. The CSI-CRCE is ever ready
                    and open to not only the students of Computer Science and Information Technology, but also
                    to every other mind in the institution.
                    One of the events held this year was the Robotics Workshop. The workshop was led by students
                    from our very own college. The purpose of this workshop was to bring together a variety of
                    talented minds to aid the Robotics section, and help it excel to a whole new level. Participants
                    of the workshop showed great enthusiasm in building the Level 1 Robot.
                    Every year during ‘CRESCENDO’ (the annual tech fest of our college), LASER TAG held by CSICRCE
                    is the most awaited and crowd-pulling event. Keeping with tradition, it was again a huge
                    success. We even had ‘LAN Gaming-Counter Strike’ that proved its popularity as usual. And
                    this year we introduced a new event, ‘The Game of Codes’ in which teams of 2 participated. The
                    event was divided into 3 rounds. A Crossword Round where a technical puzzle needed to be
                    solved, followed by a Coding Round where a problem statement was given to every team that
                    needed to be solved by programming and finally an Error debugging Round where the teams
                    had to debug the errors in the code to get a desired output.
                    Later in the semester we held a Networking Workshop conducted by Prof. Mahendra Mehra,
                    which gave the students an opportunity to learn and understand more about the network, its
                    terminologies and set up an environment for packet tracking.
                    A new inclusion in our college was the Computer week where CSI-CRCE and CODELABS
                    worked together to organize both technical and non-technical events from the 25th to the 28th
                    of January, 2015. Some of the events held were ‘Decrypt the Scrypt’, Code Attack, LAN Gaming
                    and Technocrat.
                    We express our sincere gratitude to our faculty in-charge Prof. Roshni Padate for her unflinching
                    encouragement. The programs conducted by the CSI-CRCE are benchmark programs and have
                    inspired and sown seeds for the technological future.

                <div>Among the different realms of science and technology, it is hard to think of a domain that is
                    going to change the world as much as Software Engineering. This led to the foundation of the
                    council ‘CodeLabs CRCE’.
                    CodeLabs CRCE was formed with the following as its primary objectives:
                    1. Promotion of the interdisciplinary nature of coding to students from all branches.
                    2. Development of an association with globally reputed programming platforms:
                    HackerRank and HackerEarth.
                    3. Making the students more efficient in developing production-grade code.
                    4. Organization of workshops to keep the students updated with the latest and greatest
                    in technology.
                    Being its first year, 2015-2016 has been extremely important to CodeLabsCRCE. Along with
                    CSI, we were able to conduct Fr. CRCE’s first ever Comps Week which included core technical
                    competitions like Code Attack and Technocrat, as well as non-technical and fun competitions
                    like FIFA and PhotoShot.
                    Codelabs CRCE is now associated with the college placement cell which further helps us
                    encourage students to improve their programming abilities and technical skills.
                    Along with this, a plethora of tech oriented companies, which hire through online platforms like
                    HackerEarth and HackerRank, will now be available for interested students. Thus at CodeLabs,
                    we strive to implement the council’s vision - ‘To help students of every branch be a better coder,
                    better thinker and better hire.’
                    We would like to take this opportunity to thank our teacher in-charge, Prof. Kalpana Deorukhkar
                    and the Head of the Computers’ Department, Dr. Sunil Surve for their unstinted support. We
                    thank all the council members, who have strived hard to fulfill the council’s objectives with great
                    zeal and enthusiasm. With a great start in its founding year, we at CodeLabsCRCE hope to take
                    our esteemed college to even greater heights.

                <div>With a view to encourage entrepreneurship, the entrepreneurship cell has conducted numerous
                    successful events till date and has many more to come.
                    To start with some fun, ‘FunE’ was organized to inculcate the spirit of entrepreneurship through
                    fun tasks and activities like dubsmash, karaoke, sketching trolls and solving the Rubik’s cube.
                    Students invested money in registrations and received 10 times the investment on winning. This
                    was followed by The Entrepreneurs’ Code in collaboration with the Student Entrepreneurship
                    Development (SED). With the success of this event, E-cell CRCE got affiliated with the SED.
                    E-cell then came up with The Campus Journal, in which campus related stories by the students
                    were published. At our Tech Fest ‘Crescendo’, we created an amazing UV Centre with bowling
                    and table tennis.
                    E-cell can boast of organizing, ‘The Mumbai Startup Fest’, a national level live pitching event,
                    where early stage startups present their ventures to advisors, investors and mentors to compete
                    for funding. E-cell’s flagship event Masterchef, will this year be introduced with an interesting
                    twist, wherein the participants will be able to get investments for their stalls.
                    None of this would have been possible without the encouragement of our faculty in-charges,

                    Information Technology is the youngest branch of Fr. Conceicao Rodrigues College of Engineering.
                    After its addition, the students and faculty envisioned an IT students’ chapter. After several years
                    of meetings and gaining the required permissions, the sole IT council called the ‘Information
                    Technology Students Association’ (ITSA) was formed in the year 2011. Since its inception, ITSA
                    has always aimed to expand horizons and put the fun back into engineering. ITSA’s mission is
                    to reflect the concerns of students, foster awareness on technical issues and promote interest
                    towards engineering. It is known for conducting various workshops and seminars in the IT sector
                    which helps students in their overall development. ITSA has always taken the responsibility of
                    being the only students’ association in Information Technology under the prestigious name of
                    Fr. CRCE, seriously and has always strived to push the boundaries beyond engineering.
                    The newly formed ITSA council for the year 2015-16 made their debut by conducting a hands-on
                    seminar, to make a responsive and elegant website, using the Adobe Muse software. It was a free
                    seminar and concentrated on enhancing knowledge in website designing.
                    For Fr. CRCE’s tech-fest ‘CRESCENDO’, ITSA organized 2 events, ‘CODEtective’ and ‘Console
                    Gaming’. ‘Codetective’ was in line with the famous series of Sherlock Holmes and his friend Dr.
                    Watson solving crime cases, and thus had teams of two. This Crime Thriller event had three rounds.
                    The first round was ‘The Riddler’ where the students had to solve crime cases with just a pen and
                    paper. The second round was ‘The Hunt’ where they had to hunt for the criminal, based on the
                    encrypted clues provided to them on QR codes, and the third round was called ‘The Code’ where
                    they had to solve the problem statement in any programming language in a time-limit of 2 hours.
                    The last round was judged by a TCS professional. Console gaming had 2 games namely FIFA-14
                    on Playstation-3 and NFS-Most Wanted on Playstation-2. The tournaments in both the games had
                    3 rounds followed by a semifinal and a final showdown that decided the ultimate winners.
                    Following all these successful events, ITSA came up with ‘THE IT WEEK’, filled with events that
                    justified the tagline— ‘where fun meets technology’. It was a week-long extravaganza, where
                    the fun part included events like Apple vs. Android, Wheel of Fortune, Campus Capture and
                    Lan Gaming. The Technical part had a Coding Competition-‘Code to Crack’, conducted under
                    Codechef, and the Technical Debate. There were two Interactive seminars conducted during the
                    week on two trending topics of the IT Sector – “Internet of Things” and “Data Analytics”. Thanks
                    to the efforts put in by the team, and the support by the staff members who are indeed molding
                    engineers to build the nation, the events turned out to be a great success.
                    We take this opportunity to express our gratitude to, our Teacher in-charge Prof. Saurabh Kulkarni
                    and the Coordinator of the Training and Placement Cell Prof. Mahesh Sharma, for their sturdy
                    support without which these events wouldn’t have been possible. We extend our gratitude to
                    Mrs. Jagruti Save, HOD Information Technology and the entire IT faculty for their invaluable
                    support in all our endeavors. Above all, we would like to thank the volunteers and students who
                    helped us in making this year a success. Cheers to the whole ITSA council for their sincere efforts
                    and enthusiasm, and for making the vision of ITSA, ‘Beyond Engineering’, a realistic motto.

                <div>ASME CRCE is a student chapter that enables collaboration, knowledge sharing, career
                    enrichment and skill development across all engineering disciplines. ASME stands for ‘American
                    Society of Mechanical engineers’. We promote art, science, multidisciplinary engineering and
                    allied sciences. ASME stresses not only on technical but also on other mind challenging aspects.
                    ASME conducts workshops, seminars, technical events, fun events and industrial visits. Here at
                    ASME, we believe in commitment, perseverance and backbreaking work.
                    During Crescendo 2015, ASME conducted 2 events; Propulsion and Quiz-up. ‘Propulsion’, was
                    a technical event open to students from all branches. The objective was to make a hovercraft,
                    according to the problem statement, with the materials provided by us. The second event
                    was ‘Quiz-up’. This was a fun event and received a whooping response from all the students.
                    There were more than 150 registrations for Quiz-up. The participants were allowed to take
                    quizzes on any topic from a wide range of genres. The judging criteria were the number of
                    questions answered correctly and the time taken to answer them. Winners of both the events
                    were awarded with certificates and prize money.
                    On 19th September, 2015, ASME conducted a 2-day workshop on Arena software, which is
                    used to set up production lines by industries. The participants were provided with notes, the
                    student version of the original software, and a certificate upon the successful completion of the
                    workshop.
                    We aim to achieve much higher standards than that of previous years’, under the guidance
                    of Prof. D.S. Sudhakar. Since our council is the only technical council which caters to students
                    belonging to all the 4 branches (Production, IT, Electronics and Computers), we aim to provide
                    the best professional as well as technical knowledge, and experiences that motivate our
                    members in this college. The promotion and enhancement of the technical competency and
                    the well-being of our members, is our most imperative objective. Our vision and scope is broad
                    but not unreachable as we put together our collective talents, thoughts, ideas, resources and
                    dedication to achieve the sole objective of our members’ progress.

                <div>SAE stands for Society of Automotive Engineers. The SAE collegiate club in Fr. CRCE is a
                    council, mentored by Prof. D.S. Sudhakar, which provides a platform to all those with ideas and
                    interests in technical events. We always welcome new ideas.
                    We organized two events during Crescendo 2015, Techathon and Junkyard Wars. Both these
                    events were designed to impart technical knowledge along with some fun. Techathon had a
                    series of small tasks, with clues leading to those tasks. This event was designed to teach students
                    to solve practical difficulties that fall outside course curriculums. Junkyard Wars was based on
                    the idea of creating something new out of waste materials. Many students participated in this
                    event and it gave them a new vision.
                    In September 2015, an Industrial visit was arranged by SAE to Bajaj Auto and Electro Pneumatics
                    in Pune. These visits were very educative for the students and showed them how work is done
                    in the industries, giving them a lot of practical knowledge.
                    Three teams come under SAE, TEAM VAAYUSHASTRA, FORMULA 1 CRCE and TEAM ABADHA.
                    These teams have ambitious students, always interested in developing something new. They
                    invent and use their own ideas to participate in different SAE competitions across the world.

                <div>IEEE together with WIE aims at molding engineers with state-of-the-art technologies, innovative
                    skills and values to keep up with the growing expectations of the corporate world and society, thus
                    playing an effective role in nation building. Our first event—The Technical Paper Presentation
                    was held on the 29th of July, 2015, where Prof. Sapna Prabhu of the Electronics department of
                    Fr. CRCE, shared with the students her impeccable knowledge in the field of Technical Paper
                    Writing. The seminar covered the Types and Format of Paper Writing followed by its use in the
                    electronic world and its publication. The seminar was attended by over 80 students from all
                    divisions and branches and was overall a very successful event.
                    Our level of hard work and dedication was raised as we geared up for Crescendo ’15, the annual
                    technical festival of our college. Each of our events went exceedingly well, be it Robo-Snake
                    or Virtual Reality Gaming which saw the maximum number of participants. Two new events,
                    Crack the Code and Diffuse the Bomb were also introduced this year. All the events received
                    an overwhelming response from the students of our college as well as other colleges. This
                    wouldn’t be possible without all the efforts put in by the council members.
                    We at IEEE-WIE, believe in giving back to the society. This year was no different. SPARKC, a
                    humanitarian workshop was conducted on the 26th of September, 2015 wherein the children
                    from Fr. Agnel Ashram were taught basic computing. Fifty-two children from the age group
                    of 10-15 years attended this workshop enthusiastically. Photoshop was taught to the children,
                    aged 13 and above, whereas the younger ones were taught the basics of Paint. They were then
                    encouraged to put in a bit of imagination and sketch. This was followed by a small session
                    of dancing and singing, in the classroom opposite the Computer Lab. Later, snacks and
                    chocolates were distributed. As the event came to an end, the children paraded back to the
                    Ashram, thanking each and every council member on their way out. Thus, SPARKC proved to be
                    a helpful event for the Ashram children as well as the Council Members, as both walked back
                    with a sense of joy and satisfaction.
                    That is not all. IEEE-WIE has a number of exciting events lined up in the upcoming semester
                    such as Technomania 2016. We look forward to active participation and involvement. Also, our
                    events wouldn’t have been successful without our counselors, Prof. Kranti Wagle (IEEE) and
                    Prof. Garima Tripathi (WIE), who have constantly supported us. We would therefore urge all the
                    readers to be a part of this prestigious and fun-filled council, to really enjoy life at Fr. CRCE as
                    engineering students.

                    We at NSS CRCE, endeavor to give our best to accomplish this through various activities,
                    to bring change in our college and community. Through Social Service, our unit has been
                    assisting volunteers to learn more about themselves. We are grateful to Dr. Hemant Khanolkar,
                    Prof. Saurabh Korgaonkar, Prof. Archana Lopes and Prof. Nilesh Patil, for backing us in all our
                    endeavours.
                    With a total of 100 volunteers enrolled, the NSS Unit commenced their journey by
                    assisting the Happy Hours Workshop (A unit of the multiple handicapped) to sell Rakhis and
                    other decorative items in college, which were made by special young adults, who wanted to
                    contribute and work for society after leaving school.
                    Our next event was ‘Mumbai Behind the Scenes’, a competition which was organized
                    during our college technical fest – ‘Crescendo’. Like previous years, the event witnessed great
                    participation from teams not only from Fr. CRCE, but also from other colleges. Teams were
                    presented with topics on social problems in Mumbai, and had to give practical solutions for
                    the same. Along with this, a small workshop-cum-seminar was conducted in collaboration with
                    ‘Maharashtra Andhashraddha Nirmulan Samiti’. The objective was to enlighten students in the
                    form of skits, songs, or dialogue, about the evils of superstitions. Both the events attracted a
                    large audience, which included both, faculty and students.
                    Next was the first ‘Two Day Area Based Activity’ at Wada, Palghar. The work undertaken
                    during these two days was tree plantation, filling of nursery bags, cleaning and road building.
                    This was followed by a group of activities, the first being an ICTC visit to Bhabha Hospital,
                    Bandra, where a short session was arranged to educate students on HIV and AIDS. A seminar
                    on the same was also conducted by Dr. Sr. Beena, Medical Superintendent of Holy Family
                    Hospital, Bandra, in our college. A First-Aid Seminar was conducted by the students of Seth
                    G.S. Medical College for our volunteers, followed by a blood donation drive in collaboration
                    with Holy Family Hospital, where around 50 blood packets were collected.
                    After a span of time, our unit geared up for the 7 day camp at Khamgaon, in Raigad
                    district from 24th – 30th December, 2015. The same village was visited by our college in 2014.
                    Our unit was accompanied by our Program Officer, Mr. Saurabh Korgaonkar. Our students
                    volunteered in activities such as rainwater harvesting, transfer of fertilized soil and cleaning of
                    a nearby village. Volunteers performed street plays on sanitization, superstition, child marriage
                    and abortion. Members also interacted with the villagers, thereby strengthening the bond
                    between Fr. CRCE and the villagers of Khamgaon.
                    In the beginning of the even semester, members volunteered for a small part of the
                    National Pulse Polio Immunisation Program at Naigaon. They also undertook a cleanup drive
                    at Juhu Beach, initiated a newspaper collection drive and organized a Self Defense Seminar in
                    college.

                The 8th of July, 2013 saw the assimilation of a group of souls who had taken up - in their opinion
                - the best form of engineering there was. Six semesters and umpteen subject abbreviations later, they
                realized they were right!
                This is the story of BE Electronics batch of 2016.
                Starting with the most scenic possible view on the 7th floor, SE Elex began its journey towards
                achieving a goal which it achieved only in Third Year.... A classroom of its own. For this batch has
                been
                tossed around classrooms like a table tennis ball in the 6th floor Gymkhana. And the addition of Diploma
                students in the month of August 2013 lent different shades to this group which was beginning to co-exist
                as friends and colleagues.
                Ours was the first batch to be graded by the University’s new CGPA system and boy did we
                rock it. So much so, that out of 10, our topper scored 10.04! Studying for exams was always a group
                effort. Even those who “cannot study out of eBooks” are seen staring at their mobile screens. The most
                nondescript of persons would be the first to ask teachers for question banks. As usual, each question
                will
                be tougher than the next. But that’s where we turn to our best friend...
                TECHMAX!! Also known as ‘This is probably the only book with which I will pass’. These books
                have probably saved more lives than disaster helplines. Hardcore reference book users (do they even
                exist?) cannot downplay the confidence they gain when they see the entire syllabus in one go.
                Assignments were given regularly by teachers, usually all subjects at the same time. But we take it up
                as
                a challenge (Read: One person takes it as a challenge) and complete it before you can say Ctrl+C and
                Ctrl+V.
                Submission days were like picnics and reams of assignment sheets were always present for ‘co-operative
                completion’. ‘This is such a pointless exercise’, he said, as he filled up another page of the
                assignment.
                Vivas... This one word sends down shivers down each
                spine. The exam before the exam. And the one day we realise the importance of time.
                If you are one of the first to exit, be sure to give out sound bytes to your eager ‘fans’.
                Semester endings are usually celebrated with sailing parties. And if you don’t get this, you probably
                aren’t familiar with Bandstand.
                Councils – Groups of students teaming up to organise events and functions as a local college
                chapter of international organisations (Sometimes read as: Certi dude!). Elex 2016 has been at the
                forefront of every major council operating in the college. The core of the Students’ Council 2014-15 was
                from this class as was the IEEE Council of the same year. At the same time, the Project Cell was headed
                by members of Elex 2016, who participated in various technical competitions.

                Technical Teams – Groups of students teaming up to design and develop vehicular and robotic
                devices to compete in national and international level technical competitions (Sometimes read as: Certi
                dude!). E-Yantra, SAE Aero-Design, Baja, Supra, Robocon, Karting, Outback. There is an Elex footprint
                in each of these competitions. When we get going, stuff gets going. This also explains why our class is
                half-empty during lectures because somehow, all of us are busy at the same time.
                Projects are where we have shined since the start. From accelerometer-controlled gestures and
                colour sorting mechanisms to can-filling systems and eye-controlled wheelchairs, we have done it all. If
                you think your project is fancy, drop by our class and reassess.
                As for sports, we have represented the college in football and cricket at the University level,
                securing laurels at various inter-collegiate events.
                At the inter-class level, we have consistently finished in the top two for two consecutive years
                in cricket. At the same time, we have secured various medals in athletics and rink sports. And yes, we
                are the Tug-o-War Kings. In a college with a strong Production presence, that’s saying something. In
                badminton and chess too, we have finished in the top 4 consistently and have been in the reckoning for
                the Sports Trophy for two straight years.
                On the flipside, our football stats are legendary. Frankly, how else can you describe a three-year
                goalless drought! That’s right, this has to be a record that every class from now on wants to beat.
                Last but not the least, Euphoria!
                Elex 2016 has always participated in all events of Euphoria wholeheartedly, whether organising
                or competing. Along with the entire SE, we secured Best Dance in 2014 and won many other events.
                In fashion show too, we finished third in the year 2015 in our first attempt. It is not for nothing that
                our
                performances are looked forward to every year and this year too, we will be going out with a bang!
                A special mention of our Class (and Constant) Representative (Sorry can’t think of anything more).
                Now...
                Four years of assignments (a.k.a copy writing), examinations (like GoT Winters) and placements
                (TCS or Accenture?) later, did we achieve what we set out to? That’s another story altogether. Well,
                nothing more to ramble about, so...
                ....For #OneLastTime... GO ELEX!

                Our journey started with the inclusion of this one total halfwit; never knew a thing, but boasted
                plenty. He came, he saw
                (and did some pretty stupid things), he conquered! This started an unfortunate chain of events, the
                first of which compelled our
                dear classmate Shravan to become more responsible for his belongings. He is a unique specimen in
                himself; while others leave
                their footwear on the floor outside the lab during practicals, he wraps up his slippers and places it in
                his bag ….. which is placed
                inside another bag! Pretty Awesome Right!?
                This one incidence taking place in the practicals doesn’t mean that the theory lectures are altogether
                uneventful. While
                you can do whatever you want when the teacher faces the board, but when she turns around, the universal
                rule is to SHUT UP!
                not shout ‘Jai Mata Di’ while standing up in front of the whole class. Unfortunately, Anurag failed to
                grasp this simple concept.
                Guys tend to show their muscular strength in sports but that’s not quite what happened in our class.
                Everyone dreams
                of going places, but not everyone ends up in the Casualty Ward at Holy Family after arm wrestling Ambar.
                Now that we have
                spoken about Ambar his ex-homie, Abhinav, cannot go unmentioned. Encroachment of assets earns you a loud
                ramification
                witnessed by everyone. Abhinav learned this the ‘hard’ way. This landed him in the toilet to wash away
                his sins. (Now, here we
                boast our poetic skills)
                But instead of washing away his sins, in the mirror he saw his face;
                there was nothing he could see, but disgrace.
                Then he got angry and broke the mirror on the wall;
                but guess who took the fall.
                The one who took the fall is the one who’s spirits are always ‘high’;
                he left his ID card there for even dimwits to identify.
                This is what we call #Thuglife.
                From practical labs and classrooms to even the washrooms the guys from our class always make their
                presence felt; toh NSS
                camp bhi kya cheez hai!? In kindergarten, we were taught not to play with FIRE, but Ambar was absent!
                “Because some men aren’t logical, some men just want to watch the world BURN.”
                Can Ambar’s present bestie go unmentioned, now that we have talked plenty about Abhinav?
                Lost and Found’s new Location – Panchal’s OLX Account
                Username: PanchLnF
                Lost something? This is the place to go! We are pretty sure,
                this place is frequented by Rohit the most!
                It is not the recognition that BE-IT needs but the recognition that BE-IT deserves. Our contribution to
                the college is tremendous
                in the eyes of all the students who dance to the tune of Moodle submissions. If you ever find Moodle
                unresponsive thank
                Sandesh! Now you know who to contact when you have assignments, submissions, tests and all that shiz.
                Just kidding, fellas;
                you’re still gonna have to do it all!
                Now that we have spoken about the people who are in the class, let’s talk about the people we dearly
                miss.
                One of them was a guy who became a billionaire by collecting money for Xerox. Then there was the
                “helpful” one who provided
                instant solutions for every assignment and question bank that existed. Also, we were gifted brilliant
                football players by our
                seniors; but we are a good class, we are selfless, we added a few more players to them and generously
                passed them on to our
                juniors. And, they helped them get to the finals of the Football Tournament. Such is our gratitude.
                In SE, everyone had come from different FE classes, and some even from diploma. These silly little
                incidents brought
                us together as a class, united us and helped us all showcase our skills in a much effective way! The
                talents that our classmates
                possess are tremendous and these newfound friendships assisted us in achieving greater things!
                Having a class full of all-rounders, we not only have IT’ers performing weird antics, but we also have
                individuals like
                Kaushal, Ronak and Karthik, in the top 10, who have displayed brilliant academic prowess throughout our
                4 years. Coders from
                our class have displayed their brilliance across many events like Rigved in JP Morgan’s Code for Good,
                and Abhinav, Karthik,
                Ronak and Tabish in TCS Code Vita. Karthik, Sitalaxmi and Tanvi stood 1st amongst all Mumbai University
                students in the BNP
                Paribas’ competition: Ace Manager.
                Ronak from our class has been one of the most consistent performers for Robocon and was the Coding
                Leader for the
                year 2014-15. Arush has been in the Design Team of Vaayushastra for the year 2013-14.Our class made
                notable contributions
                to the Students’ Council in the form of Ruchira, the Sponsorship Head, and Sanyukta, the Joint Creative
                Head and FragMag
                Marathi Editor. Before our third year started, it was pre-decided that it would be the last year of ITSA
                after which it would be
                dissolved. But, our classmates slogged it off, revived the IT Week and brought ITSA to reach such new
                heights that the decision
                of dissolution was revoked; and all this was due to their sheer hard work!
                For us, not even the sky is the limit! In addition to academics, we have been performing stupendously
                and winning in all
                other extracurriculars as well! We, as Second Year Students, all came together during Euphoria and
                helped the SE’s win the Best
                Year Dance. We are proud to say that the then SE-IT was one of the major contributors for this dance.
                Performers like Abhishek,
                Ruchi and Sweety have danced in the Paridhaan Team and have represented our college in many festivals
                and events. Abhishek
                has won the Dance Faceoff in TE.
                The Dramatics Club in our college had its first play the previous year, and we are proud to say that
                Tryambak was one
                of the leads of that well-acclaimed play. We also have accomplished musicians, namely Kevin and Rohan
                who play the Piano and
                Drums respectively. Kevin has bagged the first place in the Iran League and Rohan has performed for the
                college band across
                many colleges in Mumbai. During Euphoria, when in TE, Sitalaxmi secured the third place in the
                Interclass Singing Competition.
                Coming to sports, our boys TT team has been winning the interclass Table Tennis Tournaments for the past
                two years.
                We also won the gold for Boys Badminton in SE and the silver in TE. Parth has been awarded the best TT
                and Badminton player
                in SE. The Boys Rink Football team were the runners up in SE. Under the able guidance of our very own
                Coach Kabir Khan,
                Abhishek, the girls Rink Football team won the Girls Rink Football in BE. In SE, the Boys Basketball
                team went on to secure the
                second place in the Interclass Basketball Tournament. The Boys Cricket Team secured the fourth place in
                the Interclass Cricket
                Tournament in BE.
                Now that we are nearly through our three years of togetherness we would like to give away Na-Real awards
                for the class of
                BE-IT 2015-16.

                As is the tradition every year, this B.E. Production article too was written in haste, after constant
                coaxing,
                cajoling, & downright threats of the magazine going to print without the Production article. It’s a bit
                ironic that a
                class of people who were taught to produce “what’s needed, where it’s needed, when it’s needed” all
                throughout
                their curriculum, would do the exact opposite. But, as a class, ironies are one of our idiosyncrasies.
                Since the members of the technical teams are already aching to read about their accomplishments (or the
                lack of them), let’s start there. Now, the majority of the members of the technical teams of Fr. CRCE,
                come from our
                class, and that is a subject of pride amongst us. Let’s be honest, the endless after-hours slogging,
                actual application
                of mind (rather than mugging up techmax *cough* IT/Elex/Comps*cough*), and the capability to spend
                nights
                subsisting on samosas and Red Bull, is something that is possessed only by Production students.
                Starting with the most successful technical team, Team Vaayushastra, which participated in the SAE-AERO
                in
                Texas and Florida in 2014 and 2015 respectively and stood 7th (out of 10) and 5th globally, the first
                Indian team to
                do so. Not only that, but they bagged the 1st prize in design presentation, and stood 1st among the
                teams from Asia
                Pacific. This feat seems highly unlikely considering the Vaayushastra team consisted of jokers from our
                class such as
                Prathmesh & Jigar. But kudos to them for doing so well in in the competition, while still maintaining
                stellar academic
                performances.
                The Team Abadha, inspite of having senior (more like senior citizen) members like Gaurav Parab, as a
                part
                of their team, somehow managed to bungle up the virtual round for SAE-Baja in 2014-15, bringing great
                dishonour
                upon their ancestors (the previous Abadha teams). However, to their credit, they did go on to
                participate in the
                International Series of Karting, Bangalore, which apparently only had teams from India, and stood 7th
                all over India
                and won the best prize for manufacturing.
                The Team Pravega, who call their car an F1 car (showing profound ignorance about what an F1 car actually
                is) was the first team from our college to compete with international teams in designing a Formula SAE
                car in the
                FSAE Japan in 2014. Operating on a shoestring budget, their attempts to glory can be best described as
                flying on
                a wing and a prayer. On a trip to Japan that was more tourism than actual competing, this team managed
                to stand
                second amongst all the competing Indian teams. Considering that our team’s final score was in the
                negative (not
                kidding), and the car didn’t even start (not kidding here, either), it’s scary to imagine the
                performance of the other
                Indian teams. So much for #MakeInIndia.
                Now that the ridicule/praise of the technical teams is done with, let’s move on to the rest of the
                class. Our
                class has its fair share of greats and not-so-greats, whose achievements range from causing disruption
                in lectures, to
                winning national level competitions. One prank that the faculty never got wind of was the suspicious and
                conspicuously
                timed, powering on and off of Prof. Swapnil Marwadi’s projector during lectures. The entire prod faculty
                must have
                brainstormed the possible causes of this strange phenomenon, however until now, no faculty member knew
                that
                the real cause was a person, who shall stay unnamed, controlling the projector with a mobile app. Moving
                on from
                pranks and general debauchery to actual achievements, from technical competitions to sports and
                athletics, we have
                no dearth of high achievers. Aniruddh, the best known unrequited lover in our class, has done us all
                proud with his
                runner up position in the national level CAD competition held by CADD Centre. Pratik & Jigar, co-founded
                a startup,
                “Bookmarked”, an online portal for engineering literature which, according to them, gained huge
                popularity
                amongst students. That being said, this company will probably apply for bankruptcy 3 years from now. In
                addition
                to this, we have several students who have published technical papers in various international journals,
                and also a paper (which was written by three, but presented by one, owing to
                undisclosed “personal” reasons) which was presented in UC Berkeley.
                When it comes to performance in the field, our biggest achievement
                was winning the sports trophy in the 3rd year. This was made possible by the boys’ football victory,
                which was won
                by compensating for their lack of football skills by ragging on, and roughhousing the more effeminate
                members of
                the opposition (*cough*IT*cough*), as well as the performance of the Volleyball “team” (Shubham plus 5
                extras).
                The athletics events also contributed to this achievement, thanks to Dishant’s undoubtedly steroid
                propelled efforts
                on track. The girls’ participation in sports events was limited to Vipasha’s 5 medal haul on the track,
                owing to
                strong winds in the right direction, on sports day. The other girls showed lack of interest in sports,
                one can only
                contemplate, due to unknown (maybe even to themselves), political issues.
                This article would be incomplete without mentioning the various cliques in our class. The first group
                will
                be the Diploma gang which is infamous for using never-heard-before Hindi expletives and also for
                breaking into
                impromptu cheap B-Grade Hindi/Bhojpuri/Marathi songs during lectures. And who can forget the poster that
                the
                diploma guys made and hung in class in honour of Avasare’s second rank, in the second year? The money
                and effort
                spent in pulling of this stunt truly proves how devoted the Prod guys can be to frivolous pranks. The
                latest addition
                to this group has been Malhar, who’s found solace in Parab’s company, after being rejected elsewhere.
                Another
                person worth mentioning is Avinash, who will misconstrue as much as a glance in his direction, by any
                girl, as an
                indication of romantic interest. Unfortunately, most of these folk wouldn’t understand what’s written
                above, due to
                their only exposure to the English language being limited to the sort of films watched on mute.
                Behind this section sits the group of misfits which contain reticent people like Mandar & Haware, the
                uninhibited like Sana, whose sartorial gaudiness will put the most radical of fashion designers to
                shame, the reckless
                like Shashank, as well as those who wouldn’t find fitting vests in the men’s section, such as Manek and
                Raj. As far as
                Shashank goes, he’s well known for making several lascivious film posters starring classmates and also
                for sharing
                his wealth (valued in Gigabytes) during the virtual drought imposed by the Indian Government. The
                deadlines for
                submission are set by the two adorable creatures, Manek & Bade, forcing the rest of us to abide by them.
                Always closest to the black board, in the centre column, sits the group, which boredom, if wasn’t an
                abstract
                quality, would aptly personify. Of course, we’re referring to the diploma girls and the guys who sit in
                front of them. If
                sincerity could kill, these people would be the first victims. Behind these people lies the rejected
                batch of the class,
                which comprises of the Bile, Bhayani and Dinesh whose only contribution to the class must be buying
                jerseys. This
                also includes the toxic waste that is Prathamesh, coming in whose vicinity would cause decay of your
                brain cells.
                Stationed behind these people is the Gujju Gang, starring all Shahs as well some unnoticeables such as
                Stayferd, Vivek & Harshraj and the very noticeable (even from the moon) Sankalp. You’ll find this
                section of the class
                crowded only during the lunch breaks, courtesy their dhoklas, fafdas, the only reason people know or
                care about
                their existence. This paragraph might seem a bit lacklustre, compared to the others, but honestly it’s
                the people that
                are bland, not our writing.
                The next group, whom we affectionately call the “Gossip Girls”, constitutes of the conjoined lovers,
                Rounak
                & Diwakar along with the previously inseparable, but now separated Pratiksha and Ragini. Rounak and
                Diwakar are
                best known for brown nosing the faculty and each other, figuratively and literally, respectively. As for
                the remaining
                gossip girls, as much as they like to gossip about others, more animatedly than middle aged divorcees at
                a kitty
                party, our ability to write about them is severely constrained by their tendency to not take any joke
                sportingly, as
                well as their proclivity to whine to the faculty about the same (we hope they don’t complain about this
                as well).
                Then comes the 2 Snow Whites and the 7 Dwarves, and one Giant. The suppressed enmity between one
                particular dwarf and the giant over one of the Snow Whites, used to be the talk of the class. One of the
                dwarves,
                the red-eyed one (caused by “four twenty”), nearly went behind bars for harassment by chalk. (details
                only known to
                specific groups). Another dwarf, whose persona could be best defined by the phrase, “All brawns, and no
                brains”,
                is best known for his rubbish arguments and the general malarkey that comes from his mouth. As far as
                the second
                Snow White is concerned, she has always left her not-so-secret admirer waiting in limbo. Ishan spent a
                lot of time
                pumping up his tiny frame in the gym, to convince Pranav to let him be the top every once in a while, to
                no avail.
                The towny dwarf, Jay was always least concerned with what was going on in our class, since his “Desire”
                (not the
                car) was in the class that was one year our senior. In addition to this, a group of electrons always
                rotated around this
                group, however their attempts at getting in can best be described as “kabaab mein haddi”, literally
                haddi in case of
                Umang and metaphorically, in case of Abhay.
                Last, but not the least, this list couldn’t be complete without remembering the dearly departed, those
                who
                graced us with their presence for a short while, but left before their time came, i.e. the droppers.
                Prathik Devadiga
                left engineering to pursue a more lucrative career driving taxis in Dubai (let’s be honest, it pays more
                than being
                anengineer in India), while Shweta’s drop made the food and drink lose its savour for the likes of
                Prathamesh and
                Sachin. Others, like Dhede, Ketki and Badge never really left, taking every chance they could get, to
                visit our class
                in free time.
                I’m sure we rustled quite a few jimmies with our writing, which was precisely our intention. But we
                could do this
                without fear of repercussions, because we know that this is a Production class, and we can take jokes
                sportingly,
                and we’re sure that the people made fun of, will also join us in laughing their hearts out over this
                article that is
                quintessentially Prod. And on this note, we bid adieu.

                The eternal question that plagued Shakespeare’s Hamlet, which pursued humanity for ages
                and which haunted us from the moment we gave our board exams, ‘To BE || not to BE’.
                While we faced this conundrum during every submission, at every viva, while writing every
                paper, while checking every result and while battling what we hoped was the last of the KT’s,we
                did finally manage to”DO” the BE. The opalescent populace of the class which first met as
                of a bunch of unruly teens armed with their ignorance and idiosyncrasies which were at first
                insufferable then tolerable and finally endearing and to graduate now as adults with perhaps a
                little less ignorance. Between the tons of segmentation faults and the billions of infinite loops,
                we managed to learn a few things and forget some more. Bound together by papa’s wish to
                have an engineer in the family and of course the love for coding, our camaraderie grew as we
                shared codes and we went from strangers to friends to one large green family.
                A family full of variety and disorder which has the quirky geniuses, the medal decorated
                sportspersons, the know-it-alls and the say-it-alls, the silent ones and the loud ones, the singers
                and the croakers, the dancers and the choreographers, the hermit and the people living in the
                cloud, those ones and the twins the council creators and council wrappers, the debaters, the
                peripatetic over achiever, ….phew! We do enjoy an all-CRCE cachet.
                These four years have taught us more than Tannenbaum or Galvin could ever teach us. We
                survived every storm, every breeze as we sailed through this voyage of wisdom, lunacy, discipline
                and chaos. It coaxed us to overlook the confines of our own gangs and come together as a class
                when the times asked for it. It sparked our creative side, as we all prepared in unison for our
                class dance. The numerous proxies we made for each other, in sickness and in health, taught us
                to have each other’s back all the time. One could even call this a holy expedition as it brought
                light to the atheists when they finally took to kneeling and praying just so that the lectures
                would be called off. It showed us the importance of missing out on a lecture; one day you are absent and
                bam! You become the CR. It taught us to
                be punctual, a minute late and you are banned from
                entering the class, and a minute early, eh! Who comes early? It gave us the wisdom to put in the
                minimal efforts for preparing before any exam, and at the same time to take a more pragmatic
                approach during the exam.
                We are going to miss each and everything; the benches under which you can find any
                sort of stationery in case you forgot something at home, the tables on which we doodled, and
                assignment answers which we always Googled, the washrooms and the Gymkhanas which have
                always served as the perfect weekday getaways, the noise of the printers when they are out of
                cartridge, and the view of the swimming pool at Taj.
                We know, we could all have done justice to our degree, had we written that many lines
                of codes as the number of deliberations we had while planning on a mass bunk. Nevertheless,
                these same discussions made us wise over these years, and we would like to share whatever
                “gyaan” we garnered in the hope that it might help someone stuck somewhere or simply as we
                call it “hand on the torch” or in our case “hand on the algorithm to survive.”
                The transition from pre-JEE exam to post whilestill blurred and distorted in our minds
                and this one entrance exam has scarred many lives. And this post-traumatic stress disorder is
                what makes it all the more taxing to adjust in an entirely new environment in a new college and
                every small negative point is magnified. But the point is that the lift will always be crowded, the
                canteen will always run out of food and you will always have to always climb up the slope(both
                literally and figuratively), however one must know “Happiness can be found, even in the darkest
                of times, if one only remembers to turn on the light.”Besides, we all did eventually warm up to
                the place, gradually so much that it did become our second home.And as the first year went
                by, and some friendships and ground rules were established, one important thing we learnt
                in the second year was to pick up a good Wi-Fi spot. Not only should the signal be strong
                enough in that location but that spot should be discreet enough to hide you from the teachers,
                or should give you time enough to run away from the teachers. And then after all the dodging
                and the fleeing, came the penultimate year. All the seminars and the seniors giving advice and
                counselling made us really think about why we even chose to come into this branch, college,
                field, earth! We started questioning our existence. But take it from us, it is completely and
                absolutely fine to not know what you want to do after graduation, and it is perfectly normal to
                feel lost amidst MS, MBA and hopelessness. Fighting against all odds and struggling with all
                the ineptness, the final year made us realize the value of the memories molded and waiting to
                be molded. Nothing sums up the final year better than this quote, “All good things must come
                to an end, but I wouldn’t have wanted it to end any other way or with any other people.”
                All the memories are eternally entrenched in our minds. The euphoria after winning the
                dance trophy, the fear after that time we were caught bunking and the sheer unbelief and relief
                after we got off, the joy of clearing a KT, the jitters before every result, our ability to postpone
                anything and everything (thankfully not the Fragmag’s deadline for this article, though we were
                given a few, or a little more than a few, warnings before we actually submitted), the sadness
                after losing a match and the happiness of standing together as one is what makes BE COMPS.
                We waited for four years to bear us to the crossroads of our journey only to realize that in the
                darkness of the uncertainty prevailing about our future the class is the mosaic that leads us on.
                As an era ends, a feeling of sadness prevails in our hearts and we realize what Khalil Gibran
                rightly said, ’love knows not of its own depth until the hour of separation’. We paved the path
                along the slope we climbed and as we approach the countdown towards our final ascent, we
                log out not as batch mates but as a great khandaan with countless memories which we’ll never
                forget for AULD LANG SYNE!
