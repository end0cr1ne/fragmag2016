                <div>After umpteen brainstorming sessions and hours of deliberation, hoping to get our minds fixated
                    on ‘the perfect’ theme for Fragmag 2016, we finally zeroed in on this beautiful word—‘Kairos’.
                    ‘Kairos’ is a Greek word denoting ‘the right or opportune moment’. According to ancient Greek
                    mythology, Kairos, the youngest son of Zeus, was also the Greek god of opportunity. He was lithe,
                    swift on his feet and had a characteristic tuft of hair across his forehead. He could be seized by
                    his
                    forelock as he approached, but once he raced ahead, it was impossible to get hold of him, the rest
                    of his head being completely bald. He therefore served as a paradigm for—‘Seize the opportunity’,
                    reminding us to make the most of the chances that come our way, most of the time, unanticipated.
                    “There are moments which mark your life.
                    Moments when you realize nothing will ever be the same,
                    And time is divided into two parts – before this, and after this.”
                    —John Hobbes
                    Kairos is the time of expectation and excitement; it is an indefinite window of opportunity, also
                    called ‘God’s time’, which lasts for a few fugacious moments, but leaves an ingrained impression
                    on one’s life. For some, it may be the time they turned the corner to succeed in their endeavors,
                    for some, an epiphany that changed their lives, while for most others, the time when they clasped
                    promising opportunities.
                    All of us have experienced certain kairotic moments that have been
                    etched into our memories, making it possible for us to relate to the theme
                    and interpret it in our own way. The Editorial Board thus believed that
                    ‘Kairos’ was a befitting theme for this year’s edition. The overwhelming
                    response we have received from everyone has only ascertained our belief.
                    We hold extreme pride in being called the English
                    Editors of our precious college magazine and being a part
                    of the Editorial Board—a coalescence of
                    creativity, talent and zeal. We are highly
                    impressed seeing the diversity in the topics
                    people touched on for this particular theme,
                    right from philanthropy and feminism
                    to politics; many have also shared their
                    personal experiences that brought
                    smiles to our faces. Working on
                    their writings has been an incredible
                    experience, and taking a peek into
                    everyone’s minds has been
                    wonderful. None of this would
                    have been possible without
                    the constant encouragement
                    and wholehearted support of
                    Prof. Tisha Jose.
                    We hope you
                    enjoy reading the
                    magazine as much as
                    we enjoyed
                    putting it
                    together.
                    Happy

                <div>When the theme of Fragmag
                    2016—“Kairos”, was first introduced to
                    everyone, it really intrigued me, having heard
                    this word before but not knowing what it
                    really meant. I went back home and after
                    researching a lot about it, came across this: “A
                    moment in time or a timeframe in which God
                    makes it possible for something of lasting
                    importance or significance to happen”.
                    Sometimes the word kairos is
                    translated colloquially as “God’s timing”.
                    And I suddenly realized that although the
                    word may be unfamiliar to me, the concept
                    predominantly existed in our lives. Now let
                    me first narrate a simple story.
                    Once upon a time when the kings
                    ruled our country, in one such kingdom, a
                    couple was blessed with twin boys. They were
                    raised with a lot of love and affection, and
                    eventually grew up to be fine and talented
                    young men. It was now time for them to step
                    out of their house and start earning a living.
                    Both the brothers had a knack for trading,
                    and hence joined an established trader as his
                    apprentices. One fine day, the trader wanted
                    either of the brothers to travel to another
                    kingdom far away and sell cotton. Knowing
                    that cotton was not an expensive commodity
                    and that it would only fetch them negligible
                    profits, the first brother refused. The second
                    brother however, agreed and started out on
                    his journey the very next day. The second
                    brother successfully completed the work
                    assigned to him and on his return, both the
                    brothers got married.
                    A few months later, both the brothers
                    were offered to travel and sell ivory. This time,
                    the first brother enthusiastically accepted
                    the offer, but suddenly his wife fell
                    severely ill and was on her deathbed,
                    and so the assignment landed on the
                    second brother’s shoulders yet again.
                    The third time, the trader wanted
                    one of the brothers to travel and sell rubies,
                    emeralds and gold. Since the commodities
                    were valuable, he wanted to confer it to
                    someone trustworthy. Having proven his
                    worth twice to the trader, the second
                    brother was chosen this time. By then, the
                    second brother with his skills had established
                    enough trading relationships. On returning
                    from the third assignment, he resigned from
                    his apprenticeship and went on to set up his
                    own flourishing business. The first brother
                    however, remained an assistant forever.
                    Looking at the above story, many
                    of you may feel that circumstances did not
                    favour the poor first brother. But haven’t
                    circumstances always favoured the ones who
                    make the best of them? In life, our innermost
                    sensibility always urges us to wait. We wait,
                    out of greed, for better opportunities. We
                    wait, out of ego, to make peace with a loved
                    one, or to tell someone that we love them.
                    We wait, out of fear, to speak up against
                    injustice, hoping it will subside eventually. We
                    wait, always for the right moment, for God’s
                    timing. The harsh truth is that, distances will
                    only grow, injustice will only rise. We forget
                    that our biggest opportunity to do something
                    right is now.
                    Our Kairos is NOW.

                <div>Dearest Laxmi,<br/>
                    I am an indigent woman who was
                    only capable of giving you life, and my
                    reminiscences through this letter. I can
                    apprehend your abhorrence of the term
                    mother, which I certainly do not deserve to
                    be called after having abandoned you on the
                    doorsteps of your orphanage. However, with
                    the anticipation that my words will somehow
                    recuperate our relationship established and
                    broken by your umbilical cord, I write to you
                    the first and the last letter of my life.
                    I was the consequence of one of
                    the many unreported gang rapes on a
                    dispossessed woman, who was awarded
                    insanity for her incessant efforts of trying
                    to file a police complaint. As I grew walking
                    naked on the streets of Mumbai, I witnessed
                    my mother’s resolve disintegrate to lunacy.
                    One such day while she was murmuring
                    curses, tearing her tangled hair, draped in
                    a disheveled sari, she barked at a distant
                    man who carried away her daughter, but
                    did nothing to impede the kidnapping. I
                    was touched, molested and penetrated.
                    But fed, clothed and sheltered. Eventually
                    I learnt that the punishment of escape was
                    not worth the freedom. It was easier to have
                    been compensated for discordant sex, than
                    to have sought justice for it, in India. With
                    that comprehension I deliberated on an
                    occupation for my diurnal idleness. I would
                    travel in the Mumbai locals, from Churchgate
                    to Virar and back. In search for an exultant
                    and peaceful woman, in whose skin I
                    could imagine myself every night while
                    satiating the carnal needs of my client.
                    The agony of that excruciating activity
                    was subdued as I floated in my
                    imagination, somewhat like my
                    own alternative reality. Dressed
                    in civilized clothes, I would
                    ceaselessly hunt for my
                    muse, follow her,
                    investigate, try to initiate a conversation, and
                    sincerely hope that she would illustrate what
                    being happy felt like. With the commencement
                    of my quest, I was first deceived by the smiles
                    of Gauri, snuggling her infant in her sari like
                    he weighed nothing, while she advertised
                    her collection of cheap bangles and earrings.
                    For many nights I smiled like her in my
                    imaginary parallel universe until I gathered
                    some courage to talk to her. She was traded
                    (she refuses to call it marriage) by her father
                    for a sum of Rs. 2500 to a chronic alcoholic
                    who survived on her income and her body.
                    Unlike me she had learnt to paste a grin on
                    her scarred face for the sake of her children.
                    Regardless of my heartbreak, I recommenced
                    my chase. And in that expedition encountered
                    scores of Goddesses like Gauri existing in
                    their nonexistent lives. Saraswati, commuting
                    daily to drop her son to school, was a middleclass
                    housewife serving her husband and inlaws,
                    in spite of their tormenting taunts, for
                    the insubstantial dowry that she brought into
                    the marriage. An unwanted daughter and a
                    burden on her family, she was literate but
                    not educated, because her parents believed
                    that cooking and child-rearing were the only
                    skills she needed. Nevertheless her laughter
                    was capable of concealing years of neglect. I
                    also met Durga, a fearless female constable
                    whose valiance I aspired. I saw her detain
                    thieves and thrash eve-teasers outside
                    Bandra station, but it never crossed my mind
                    that her gallantry came with a cost. Her
                    working hours deteriorated her family life
                    and as it was almost impossible to ascend the
                    career ladder as a woman police officer, she
                    deliberated resigning. Then I met Sita and
                    Radhika, both were aspiring doctors. They
                    were by far the most cheerful girls I had met.
                    Sita committed suicide that August, after she
                    failed to clear her AIPMT exams for the
                    second time. But Radhika believed it was
                    also because she was body-shamed
                    for a long time by the boy she had a
                    crush on. It’s incomprehensible
                    how women hold such
                    trivialities in high regard.
                    Fortunately all prostitutes
                    skinny or otherwise earned equal
                    business. Anyway, Radhika remained
                    the inspiration of my imagination for
                    the longest period of time. She was a bold,
                    beautiful, well-educated and mature girl,
                    who had a wealthy, loving family and a lover
                    who respected her. She only ceased to be my
                    muse when she told me she had stage two
                    breast cancer. This was around the same time
                    I discovered I was pregnant. I was devastated
                    by both, the knowledge of my pregnancy
                    and the realization that for an Indian woman,
                    there is no alternative reality. She just has one
                    reality and that is the universe she is born in.
                    And my love, the universe you were going
                    to be born in would kill your soul before it
                    would liberate your body. The orphanage is
                    your parting gift. A door to a different, if not
                    a better life.
                    Laxmi, I also want you to know
                    that I never contemplated an abortion
                    because those nine months were the most
                    enlightening days of my life. In India we are
                    taught to worship our Goddesses for their
                    angelic beauty, fertility, fidelity, compassion,
                    and unrelenting capacity to love and sacrifice.
                    Be it my mother, who lives an anonymous
                    life of a lunatic or a glamorous model,
                    who dies of drug abuse, we as women are
                    expected to meet numerous unrealistic and
                    impractical anticipations of other women,
                    men and society as a whole. We are named
                    as Goddesses, expected to behave like one,
                    but seldom treated like one. However, your
                    perspective will decide whether you curse a
                    mountain for being an obstacle, stare at its
                    stark magnificence, or climb it. I chose to
                    stare. You can climb it. People will envy you,
                    hate you, outcast you, chastise you, but they
                    cannot pull you down if you don’t let them.
                    Your birth reminds me of a concept introduced
                    to me by Radhika; “Kairos”. It is the moment
                    when everything happens. People let
                    time and circumstances define their
                    Kairos. But the day you gather courage
                    to define your ‘everything’, you will be
                    everything. I have not named you after
                    the Goddess of wealth, but after the queen
                    of Jhansi. I want you, not to believe in an
                    alternate reality, but to alter your reality.<br/>
                    Happy 16th birthday.<br/>
                    Love,<br/>
                    Sati.

            <div class="coll2">
                <div>It was a cold December morning. I was
                    on my way to my aunt’s place in Churchgate.
                    It was the end of my fifth semester and I
                    was ecstatic about spending my Christmas
                    vacation with my cousins. We get along like
                    a house on fire! I packed my belongings and
                    boarded an early morning local to Churchgate
                    from Mira Road. Earphones plugged in,
                    listening to my favourite FM channel, all I
                    could think of was the fun that awaited me.
                    It had been a year since I last met them, and
                    I was really looking forward to this trip. As
                    the train halted at Dahisar, a young woman
                    boarded the train. She was amazingly welldressed;
                    with her perfectly draped sari and
                    matching jewelry she looked beautiful. It took
                    me a while to realize that she was a transgender.
                    I saw her walking towards me. I knew
                    she would ask for money like they usually did,
                    so I pretended to be asleep. She came and
                    sat right beside me and I heard a shrill voice
                    say, “Don’t worry, I won’t beg from you”. I
                    was surprised. I slowly opened my eyes and
                    looked at her. She smiled, I smirked in return.
                    “Where are you heading to?”, she asked me
                    after a while.
                    “Churchgate”, I replied. “What about you?”
                    “Same! I have an interview there.”
                    As soon as I heard this, I couldn’t resist but
                    ask,”Interview?”
                    She nodded in agreement. I could see
                    the excitement in her eyes. She began to tell
                    me her story. Then began the conversation I
                    will never forget.
                    Gunjan was born in Chennai as a boy
                    named Sharat. He belonged to a normal
                    middle class family and had two elder sisters.
                    His parents were very keen on their children’s
                    education so they put him in an all boys’
                    school. As he grew a little older, he realized
                    that he had a lot of effeminate characteristics
                    which soon caught society’s eye. “Behave
                    like a boy”, the world told him. He had to
                    face a lot of bullying, verbal abuses and was
                    the butt of all jokes in school. He had no
                    friends. It was a nightmare to go to school
                    every single day and face so much criticism.
                    There were times he used to run to the school
                    washroom and sob uncontrollably. After a lot
                    of contemplation, he realized that he wasn’t
                    living the life he wanted. His parents did not
                    understand him. At a young age of 14, he
                    packed his bags, ran away from home and
                    came to Mumbai.
                    With only Rs.20 in his pocket, he reached
                    Bandra terminus. He was scared and
                    helpless, and on that very day he met a transgender
                    named Menka who offered him a
                    water bottle, heard his story and took him
                    to her place. Menka was a social activist
                    and fought for the rights of the transgender
                    community. She understood
                    Sharat’s plight and was like a mother
                    to him. She supported his decision
                    to become a woman. And thus
                    Sharat transitioned into
                    Gunjan. Gunjan became a
                    part of the ‘hijra samaj’.
                    After two years,
                    she called her parents up to let them know
                    where she was. But sadly they did not accept
                    her. She still craves for their love. However,
                    she did not get dejected. Instead, she made
                    a firm resolution to make her mark in this
                    world. She always knew that education was
                    very important. To fund her education, she
                    began begging in the local trains and at traffic
                    signals by morning, and dancing in a bar at
                    night. After she collected enough money, she
                    decided to join a night college and complete
                    her MCom. This was going to be her sixth
                    interview.
                    “There is a lot of stigma and
                    discrimination. They think we misbehave and
                    are rude. But it’s not entirely our fault. They
                    never accepted us; they do not give us jobs.
                    That’s why my sisters have to beg. My gender
                    does not describe me as a person”, her story
                    brought tears to my eyes. I quickly wiped
                    them and scanned around to see whether
                    anyone was looking. I think she saw that.
                    “But I know I will get this job. It’s my
                    lucky day today and I’m wearing my lucky
                    sari!” I pretended to laugh, but deep down,
                    my heart was filled with empathy. As we
                    reached our destination, I waved goodbye
                    and as I walked outside the train station, I
                    made a silent prayer, hoping she gets the job.
                    How deeply stuck we are to our
                    preconceived notions baffles me. How easily
                    we treat trans-gender people as outcasts and
                    call them names. On April 2014, the Indian
                    Supreme Court declared trans-gender the
                    third gender. It’s almost a year since the ruling
                    and we still treat them so inhumanly. They
                    are still looked down on and are sometimes
                    deprived of basic human rights. The ‘hijras’
                    are not just the ones who clap and beg
                    for money or the ones who perform at
                    ceremonies for good luck. They are
                    normal people with problems, just
                    like us. This was my ‘Kairos’.
                    The moment I realized that
                    I must not judge anyone
                    on the basis of their
                    gender, caste, race or creed.
                    It is their inner beauty that
                    matters. I believe that one day we
                    will live in a country where trans-gender
                    people will be accepted, loved and most
                    importantly respected. Let’s start today. Yes,
                    it will take a long time but it’s not impossible.
                    I never met Gunjan after our train
                    encounter, but every time I board a
                    Churchgate train, I look out for her hoping to
                    hear that she got the job.

            <div class="english-title">ADVENTURE OF LIFE</div>
            <div class="coll2">
                <div>As I look back at my life I realize
                    that, every time I have been rejected from
                    something good, I have actually been
                    redirected to something better. Yes. Life is
                    always at some “TURNING POINT”. Every
                    successful person definitely has a turning
                    point.
                    An APPLE falling from a tree inspired
                    Newton to discover the Laws of Motion.
                    Overflow of WATER from a bath tub,
                    observed by Archimedes, gave the world his
                    Principles of Fluid Mechanics.
                    A moving SPIDER on the wall helped a
                    young Rene Descartes to fulfill his dream of
                    merging Algebra and Geometry as Analytical
                    Geometry.
                    Taxi NUMBER 1729 was the spark in
                    the life of Srinivasa Ramanujan that made him
                    the unmatched hero of Number Theory.
                    Everyone has a break point, turning
                    point, stress point. But what matters is
                    how best these points are understood and
                    utilized to transform life towards SUCCESS.
                    Life is unpredictable. Falling is a part of life.
                    Getting up is living. The turning point
                    can come at the age of 15 or 50. It is
                    like the SUNRISE that provides a safe
                    and bright atmosphere filled with hope
                    and confidence. If we wait too long, we will
                    miss it. It is a tool to fight the past and build
                    the future. When we focus on PROBLEMS
                    we will have more problems. When we
                    focus on POSSIBILITIES we will get more
                    opportunities. Use every opportunity as an
                    HOURGLASS to let the sufferings run down
                    and Disappear.
                    Never close the door on an opportunity.
                    If it knocks on the door, always say YES, and
                    then try to learn how to make the best use of
                    it. It comes to those who are prepared. Our
                    NO will become a YES to someone else. Many
                    of us miss it due to misperception. When a
                    wave comes, go deep and never get scared.
                    When we are in the midst of fear, and stop
                    at the dead end of our path, sometimes we
                    hear a voice saying, ‘do not lose hope, have
                    faith in yourself and move forward, come
                    whatever may’ .Today is not just another day.
                    It is a new chance, another BEGINNING.
                    Embrace it. Nothing is worse than missing an
                    opportunity that can change your life.
                    It is never too late to start over. If we
                    are not happy with yesterday, try something
                    different today and do better. A PESSIMIST
                    sees the difficulty in an opportunity. An
                    OPTIMIST sees the opportunity in every
                    difficulty. All of us do not have equal talents.
                    But all of us have an equal opportunity to
                    develop our talents. We do not have to be
                    great to start, but we have to start to become
                    great. The ladder of SUCCESS is best climbed
                    by stepping on the rings of opportunity. Many
                    of life’s failures are because we do not realize
                    how close we are to success when we give up.
                    Our future is created on, what we DO
                    TODAY and NOT TOMORROW.
                    Life is like FOOTBALL. We have to
                    tackle our problems, block our fears and
                    score goals whenever we get the opportunity.
                    Sometimes, LATER becomes NEVER. Making
                    life big is scary, but what is even scarier is
                    REGRET. We must use obstacles as the
                    stepping stones to build the life we want.
                    The PAIN we feel today is the STRENGTH
                    we will feel tomorrow. For every challenge
                    encountered, there is an opportunity for
                    GROWTH. Take an oath:
                    This moment, this day is as good as any
                    moment. I shall make this day a HEAVEN on
                    earth.
                    The ADVENTURE of life is to LEARN
                    The PURPOSE of life is to GROW
                    The NATURE of life is to CHANGE
                    The CHALLENGE of life is to OVERCOME
                    The SECRET of life is to dare.
                    Trust that God brings every person, every
                    opportunity into our life to get us what we
                    want and to where we need to be. Let every
                    moment be a TURNING POINT that leads to
                    success and happiness in life.

                <div><i>‘Freedom isn’t a tea party, India. Freedom is
                    a war.’</i><br/>
                    A war against the constant attempts
                    to derail democracy, a war against the
                    macabre slaughter of reason, a war
                    against the barbaric ideals and beliefs
                    with the solitary purpose of thwarting
                    and shunting growth which manage
                    to survive under the guise of rights
                    and liberties, and a war to let an
                    idea, a thought to exist and
                    see its day without being
                    assaulted and forced
                    behind the gates of bans, its only offence
                    being guilty of offending someone.
                    Taking offence has become one
                    of those ineluctable fashion fads which
                    supersede one another, always to serve as a
                    subject of grave concern for the impuissant
                    majority, seeking those precious fifteen
                    minutes to star in their “breaking news” and
                    hog the offended posters. Shedding crocodile
                    tears and feigning distress about things
                    people rarely comprehend is sadly in vogue
                    today. Society in the current decade, which
                    has seen a huge change in power dynamics,
                    has certainly become more regressive as it
                    assumed the role of being the upholder of
                    tradition. People either want their way or the
                    ban way. The government too, has shown
                    little resistance in letting people have their
                    way. The entire process of taking offence
                    is initiated by the powerless, who coveting
                    the media limelight, yell offence and have
                    a phalanx of dolts at the ready, armed with
                    ink, which coincidentally is the ammunition
                    of literary battles. The ban of literary genius
                    Salman Rushdie’s Satanic Verses, the forced
                    exile of the well renowned painter M.F.
                    Hussain, the ban on beef and the arrest of
                    comedian Kiku Sharda over the lampoon of a
                    self-proclaimed divine messenger in a snazzy
                    costume are the frivolous and ridiculous
                    schemes of the vain and self-interested
                    political leaders yearning to please the
                    offended for their treasured vote bank. The
                    media joins in the bandwagon with their
                    prime time slots reserved for the ban-yelling,
                    ink-wielding, FIR-lodging, office-ransacking,
                    “outraged and offended” .Take for instance
                    the AIB roast. Newspapers printed a great
                    many useless and exaggerated things with
                    the sole purpose of drawing attention to
                    themselves and out-shouting the others.
                    Celebrities thronged in to dish out
                    their views to ensure not to be left
                    out. TV reporters made it a point
                    to do their duty of getting a
                    bite from every offended
                    person except for dear India TV that religiously aired
                    their coverage of levitating
                    mountains and self-incinerating
                    phoenixes. All this hullaballoo when
                    the creators explicitly warned the feeble
                    hearted to avoid the episode!
                    In this chronic upsurge of taking
                    offence, the ones who leap in the forefront
                    are the ministers without ministries, the
                    journalists without stories, the aunties
                    without gossip, bulging middle-aged men
                    in shorts and the hypocritical god men with
                    misunderstood scriptures. With an army at
                    their disposal, the only way to stop them
                    from getting offended is to offend them
                    even more until we drain the very last bit of
                    offence from them. The hour, the minute we
                    decide to drive this flaw out from our society,
                    we will take a giant step towards making this
                    country the heaven of freedom spoken about
                    by Rabindranath Tagore. So let’s make this
                    our ‘kairotic moment’. Go Grab your pens
                    and flaunt your inked faces while keeping in
                    mind what Aristotle said, ‘It is the mark of
                    an educated mind to be able to entertain a
                    thought without accepting it’.

                <div><i>“The birds of hope are everywhere, listen to
                    them sing.”</i>
                    -Terri Guillemets
                    When I first came across these
                    powerful words, I did not fully understand
                    their significance as I continued being tugged
                    and pulled by the ebb and flow of life. As is
                    the case with most of us, I rarely paused to
                    stop and think about personal tragedies that
                    occur to others. In the past, my normal
                    reaction was to express meaningless,
                    unfelt sympathy and to carry on chasing
                    my dreams and ambitions. In short, I
                    would get sucked into the vortex of my
                    every day, fast-paced life. I was not really
                    affected by the personal tragedies of others,
                    nor did I realize the enormity of the situation.
                    It was only when I saw at close quarters,
                    how two families close to me, coped with
                    their immense problems and responded to
                    them, that I realized how my perspective was
                    narrow, selfish and limited.
                    In the first instance, there was this
                    neighbor of mine, who died of a progressively
                    debilitating illness called Parkinson’s disease.
                    After battling with it for over sixteen years,
                    he finally breathed his last. This individual’s
                    encounter with Parkinson’s also became the
                    family’s war against it. I saw with admiration,
                    how each member rallied round the patriarch
                    and gave him all their love, care and emotional
                    support unflinchingly. Of course, it took a toll
                    on their finances and severely restricted their
                    lifestyles, but they carried on uncomplaining.
                    In another poignant case, I saw true
                    love, dedication and commitment shine
                    through. This is the true story of a young
                    woman, let me call her Sona. She had a loving
                    husband and two lovely children. She had a
                    shining career, was deeply involved with the
                    progress of her children, and looked after her
                    family, including her father-in-law. However,
                    her normal existence came to a stop when
                    she was felled by a tragic stroke. In the
                    blink of an eye, the entire family’s life came
                    crashing down. She lay in a deep coma for
                    over three weeks, and the doctors did not
                    hold out much hope. When she did emerge
                    from her coma, I saw that she was fated to
                    lead a bed-ridden life of dependence. The
                    slightest movements like hugging and kissing
                    her children, or speaking to them became impossible tasks. My heart went out to her
                    husband and children for their lives were
                    shattered. Life, in my opinion, had become a
                    sheer drudgery for them.
                    When I looked at both the families,
                    I was acutely aware of the hopelessness of
                    the situation. When I saw the sufferings of
                    the individuals as well as those of their loved
                    ones, I privately thought that blissful death
                    would be preferable to a living death. When
                    death finally claimed the life of my neighbor,
                    who was suffering from Parkinson’s, I thought
                    it was a blessed relief for all those concerned.
                    However, I revised this opinion a few years
                    later, when I saw beautiful, vivacious Sona
                    and her family fight for normalcy in their lives.
                    As the months and years passed by,
                    I became aware of a lighter atmosphere
                    pervading the house, as they rejoiced in her
                    minor triumphs towards progress. I saw the
                    single-minded devotion and purpose with
                    which her husband contributed towards it,
                    ungrudgingly nursing her and carrying out
                    his responsibilities as a father and head of
                    the family. I saw the children put aside their
                    wants and desires and always considered
                    their mother’s needs. Sona did not give way
                    to despair, despondency or depression. She
                    worked hard for the slightest improvement
                    in her condition! She listened to everyone’s
                    troubles, gave them advice and consoled
                    them, when the others ought to have been
                    doing it to her. She had come a long way, and
                    as the years passed by, she still continued
                    to be her level-headed, cheerful self. All this
                    was possible because of her whole-hearted
                    co-operation, her intense faith in God and
                    her hope of regaining the ability to walk,
                    talk and be independent.
                    That was my moment of
                    illumination, my supreme ‘Kairos’
                    of awareness. I realized that
                    though life might be unjust
                    and not work out the way
                    we want it to, when we
                    ask for something immediately and it does
                    not always come; despite the odds, despite
                    the hopelessness, we have to battle on.
                    How one does it depends on the individuals
                    concerned. One could give up the fight,
                    become nasty and self-centered, or as is the
                    case with Sona and my neighbour, one could
                    find a way out and face the odds cheerfully
                    without railing at fate or God.
                    To turn adversity into hope is the
                    lesson of life I learnt. Now I fully understand
                    and appreciate the message contained in the
                    following evergreen words of comfort and
                    inspiration:
                    <i>“Whispering hope, oh how welcome thy
                        voice
                        Making my heart in its sorrow rejoice”</i>
                    Our lives are infused with pain and
                    suffering. Hope enables us to overcome
                    hardship, motivates us to persevere despite
                    the darkness, reassures us and encourages
                    us to journey onwards, despite obstacles
                    and despite not knowing how, or when, or
                    where, or why. Our life’s story will conclude.
                    Hope is a signature strength that improves
                    our well-being; providing peace of mind,
                    contentment and life satisfaction. Instead of
                    treating life like a graveyard of buried hopes,
                    we should understand that hope motivates
                    a person to achieve a desired outcome, to
                    overcome hardships, to keep trying and
                    to keep hoping despite the small odds of
                    success. I no longer desire to be the hardheaded
                    rationalist, tearing away the mask
                    of illusion from people’s faces. Instead, I
                    tend to agree with Christopher Reeves, the
                    Hollywood actor, who became a quadriplegic
                    after a riding accident and could only breathe
                    through a ventilator, <i>“Once you choose
                        hope, anything’s possible.”</i>

            <div class="coll2">
                <div>At the turn of the century, people
                    across the world had grand dreams of the
                    future. From hover boards to flying cars and
                    inter-galactic travel. However, the only thing
                    that was certainly going to change was the
                    calendar (chronos).
                    Be it new year’s eve or other auspicious
                    days, longing for, and honoring a special time
                    (kairos) has been one of humanity’s most
                    enduring endeavors. The idea that the gods
                    of the sky could foretell the unpredictable
                    ways of mother earth fascinated many early
                    civilizations. Maybe it was the idea that these
                    times, that brought prosperity (harvest) or
                    wrath (winter) were times when God was
                    somehow closer, and to an extent tangible.
                    The ancient Greeks perceived this
                    differently; they understood that not all
                    time was equal. But also believed that the
                    occurrence of a ‘special time’ was firmly
                    in their hands. In Panathenaicus, Isocrates
                    wrote, educated people are those, “who
                    manage well the circumstances which they
                    encounter day by day, and who possess
                    a judgment which is accurate in meeting
                    occasions as they arise and rarely misses the
                    expedient course of action”.
                    This realization of our control over
                    the moments in our life that define our
                    destiny opens our eyes to the value of every
                    moment. A person falling sick, a death and an
                    accident may all seem like moments of pure
                    sadness and unpleasantness but are actually
                    opportunities to reach out to grieving people
                    forging stronger bonds with them; while a
                    small seemingly insignificant action can lead
                    to a forest fire or stoke a riot.
                    Rest assured, the position of
                    the sun in the sky or the aligning of
                    five planets will never be responsible
                    for any of the successes or failures faced
                    in life. ‘Kairotic’ moments occur amidst a
                    sea of ‘chronos’.But every moment has the
                    potential to be a Kairos.
                    Throughout the day, God hands each
                    of us opportunities to be his instrument in
                    other people’s lives. Seizing the moment
                    and exploiting the opportunity at hand is
                    the difference between a life of mediocrity
                    and one of awesomeness. Often, we pray
                    fervently for something and expect the
                    ‘kairotic’ moment of deliverance to be a
                    dramatic manifestation. Like the parting of
                    the red sea. However, the reality is rarely that
                    miraculous and can be logically explained.

            <div class="coll2">
                <div>We were a perfect family of four until
                    I realized that heaven had different plans for
                    us. Be it weeks, months or years, the pain
                    of losing my dad will pinch me for the rest
                    of my life. Little did I know that he would
                    never return home that day, that it was the
                    last time I was seeing his face, that I would
                    never have someone to get me my favourite
                    candies anymore, that he would never see me
                    become an engineer, and that I would never
                    have my hero walk me down the aisle on my
                    big day. It has been three months now. Life
                    hasn’t been easy and feels like it never will.
                    Nothing that people say makes sense right
                    now. Sometimes, I wish I could turn back the
                    clock just to hug him tight and never let go…
                    I called him my ‘walrus-daddy’ cause
                    of his huge built and soft heart. We shared a
                    perfect father-daughter relationship, where I
                    could pour my heart out to him without the
                    fear of being judged. He was an obedient
                    son, a loving husband and a wonderful father.
                    Dadda didn’t tell me how to live life; he lived
                    and let me watch him do it. I realized that any
                    man could be a father but it takes a real man
                    to be a ‘Dad’! Also, they say hard times help
                    you push your limits and test your strength.
                    I figured out how true that was when I was
                    back to college the day just after I lost him.
                    I gave my practical exam and headed back
                    to school that evening to run the alumni race
                    only to return home winning it. All I could
                    do was look up to the heavens and smile,
                    knowing that he was watching me. He carried
                    me in his arms. Today, I carry him in my heart.
                    I know this for real that no matter whose love
                    gives me happiness, I’ll never find any like his.
                    His memories will remain etched in my heart
                    forever. I know he’s having a blast up there
                    and I can’t wait to meet him again! Until then,
                    those brisk winks and flying kisses to the sky
                    will continue and I will live to make him smile.

            <div>The roaring motorcycle engine
                shuddered to a halt as he pulled into one of
                Santacruz’s dimly lit bylanes. On a whim he
                decided to haunt the spot for a bit longer.
                He bought a Cornetto from the dusty old
                general store nearby and leaned against
                the bike, enjoying the state of isolation.
                Across the street was a
                photocopy booth, ‘ZEROX’
                misspelt in bold across their
                banner. Their printer room,
                housing all the expensive
                machinery, had a light on to ward off deviant
                minds. Against this light, he perceived a
                silhouette, basking in the shaded comfort of
                the outer desk.
                Her face was illuminated by the
                lighter’s flame as she lit up a cigarette. She
                had a round but pretty face and wore a leather
                jacket over a red dress. In the familiarity of
                his surroundings, the stranger’s presence
                piqued his curiosity. “I must talk to this girl,”
                he thought. Disposing of the remains of his
                Cornetto, he walked up to her. “Where’d
                you get that smoke?” he asked, knowing,
                the only spot anyone could procure any sort
                of contraband at that ungodly hour was the
                lone chaiwala who usually parked a good
                kilometer away. “What?” she retorted, her
                voice soft and melodic even in her startled
                state. “The smoke. Where’d you get one
                around here?” he reiterated, with the most
                cringe-worthy grin he could summon. Her
                face stretched into an angelic smile as she
                pointed to the lane’s end. As he turned his
                head, his face fell with a single glance, having
                realized that the cursed chaiwala had picked
                that very corner as his base of operation
                that day. Shooting another grin, he walked
                away towards his malicious antagonist. He
                bought a single Marlboro and walked back
                to his bike. His yearning to communicate his
                curiosity was strong, but his courage had
                now failed him. He lifted his hand in salute
                as he lit up. She returned the gesture with
                another smile. Sweet mercies! She soon got
                done and began to walk to the other end
                without sparing him another look. It was the
                last time he ever saw her, as she turned at
                the corner, ‘the girl on the desk’. He’d dueled
                loss before, knowing all the usual emotions
                in its company, but in that moment he didn’t
                feel any of them, only a dull ache at the
                bottom of his chest. She could’ve been
                anyone, meant anything—a friend,
                an acquaintance, a fleeting muse,
                even “The One”. He had let
                his opportunity slip away, even with Lord Kairos smiling
                down from the heavens.
                Stubbing out death, he woke the
                roaring beast and rode back to the
                promise of warmth and comfort.
                Life is a winding road, with its ups and
                downs, sharp turns and sudden forks. Each
                path you see leads to an unknown destiny.
                This is why it is ruled by the choices you
                make. Opportunities aren’t always made to
                be grasped. Let some slip away like sand
                through your fingers. Although things are
                meant to end, they may also be a means to
                an end. Weigh each choice like you know
                your destination.

            <div class="coll2">
                <div>life that fell in the ‘Kairos’ category, I came
                    up short. If asked about their Kairos, others
                    would probably recount some life-altering
                    experiences. It was then that it occurred
                    to me! What about the smaller moments in
                    life? The ones that made a difference, but
                    had been chalked up as everyday stuff. Like
                    getting butterflies in my stomach when the
                    guy I like smiles at me, or that feeling of
                    triumph when I prove someone wrong. It’s
                    that moment when inspiration struck and
                    enabled me to put pencil to paper.
                    Kairos means the right or opportune
                    moment, derived from the Greek God of
                    Opportunity, Caerus. Caerus, though said
                    to be handsome, had absolutely no sense
                    of style. According to legend, he had a long
                    fringe in the front and was absolutely bald
                    at the back. So our little Hermeswannabe
                    (yes, he had wings on his feet
                    too) could easily be seized by the hair
                    hanging over his face when he was arriving.
                    But once he passed by, no one could grasp
                    him. The back of his head being bald. This
                    led to the phrase “seize the opportunity”.
                    But not all of my ‘kairotic’ moments
                    were of the ‘carpe diem’ variety. Some
                    existed right in front of me. I just had to
                    open my eyes to see and appreciate them.
                    It’s those little moments that happened often
                    but I hadn’t taken the time to notice.
                    They were everyday moments like
                    joking with friends on the hour-long walk
                    home, or the pleasure I felt when someone
                    complimented my sketch of the day. Also
                    times like, when I managed that fluke headshot
                    and the guys cheered like crazy, or when
                    my code was finally bug-free (or so it seemed).
                    It was these moments that made my
                    life unique and if not for them I wouldn’t be
                    where I am.

                    precious little moments in your life too? Dig

            <div class="coll2">
                <div>Lethargically walking up the slope
                    to college, dreaming of what the day could
                    possibly have in store for me, out of the blue,
                    a little finger tugged at my hand. I turned
                    around to a little girl saying, “Didi Didi! My
                    mother wants to talk to you”. Shaken out of
                    my reverie, I saw a weary eyed woman in a
                    drab sari staring at me intently.
                    “Could you please do me a favour?”
                    she mumbled. Strange ideas ran through my
                    mind, wondering what she could want from
                    me. Just before I could refuse, she went on
                    to say, “My daughter is giving her SSC boards
                    this year. She will be the first educated girl in
                    our family. A little guidance here and there
                    will boost her to go ahead. I know you can do
                    this. God will bless you!” I was taken aback.
                    ‘Maa ki dua se Zindagi Jannat Se Kum Nahi
                    Hoti … Jannat toh insaan ke naseeb mei hona
                    ek alag hi ehasaas hai’, these lines once said
                    by my aunt to somebody came to my mind.
                    My mind started racing and I wondered
                    if I’d be able to do justice to the faith she
                    had in me. I had kept away from NSS and
                    other social service programs as I barely had
                    any time to spare and wanted to focus on
                    my academics. Here, I was at a crossroads,
                    deciding to help an unknown person with nil
                    rewards, just 100 meters away from college.
                    Nevertheless, I went ahead just for
                    the kick of doing something different. It was
                    an unusual experience— managing college,
                    projects, assignments and teaching from
                    scratch. Many thought I was being stupid in
                    going out of my way to help somebody who
                    didn’t have much scope. But the inner joy
                    that it gave me was indescribable.
                    To cut the long story short, weeks
                    turned to months, and with a little extra
                    coaching, she gave her Board Exams. I didn’t
                    hear from her for three months after the
                    exam. Coming out of college one day, after
                    my dismal performance in my semester,
                    apprehensive of the magnitude of drama
                    awaiting me at home, I stopped in my
                    tracks when I heard the familiar “Didi,
                    Didi!” I was filled with nostalgia. I
                    turned around to see my ebullient
                    student, beaming with joy and
                    offering me a box of sweets.
                    The excitement in the Doeshaped
                    eyes said it all. I
                    saw her mother standing at a distance, her
                    eyes filled with pride. That was my ‘kairos’; it
                    made me believe in my existence.

                <div>“Offo! Do I need to change your diaper
                    again?” my grandma stared, wide-eyed, at
                    those beady black eyes as they stared back,
                    empty.
                    “All the time, like a baby! You should make
                    some effort to get up too. I cannot lift you
                    alone”, she said.
                    “You keep quiet! I cannot get up if you keep
                    talking”, he said.
                    “This is what I get for helping”, she muttered.
                    “I did not ask for your help”, he retorted.
                    This was daily drama; like that running
                    in old heritage theatres every day, without a
                    slight change. The old couple would quarrel
                    like children, one out of exhaustion and the
                    other out of helplessness.
                    With Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s
                    combined, for Grandpa, life was like one
                    of those nightmares in which the monster
                    chases you, but neither can you escape nor
                    call for help because you are paralyzed and
                    mute at the same time. Getting up was like
                    going for a test. A trip to the washroom
                    was as tiring as mountain trekking. Eating
                    was a pain in the neck, with all those dietary
                    restrictions, and bed was the only place of
                    comfort and solace. In addition to all this, a
                    physiotherapy session every Wednesday that
                    felt like an approaching Monday.
                    This is just a small glimpse of
                    what the second infancy brought to
                    grandpa. He would often recite
                    those catchy phrases from TV
                    ads randomly, talk about incidents which never took
                    place, and sometimes even forget
                    who we were. For most of the time, he
                    would sit on his chair and gaze emptily into
                    the space at his front, where Grandma would
                    appear from time to time to cater to him.
                    I remember that day when Grandma fell
                    ill and we took care of them. His day started
                    as usual. He woke up, had his breakfast,
                    spent the afternoon watching TV, blabbered
                    trivial things at odd times. He was indifferent.
                    But of course, he wasn’t to be blamed. It was
                    the work of those witches inside his head,
                    posing in the form of Alzheimer’s. Grandma
                    on the other hand kept worrying about him
                    all day, “Did he get up? If he doesn’t wake up
                    on time, he’ll get acidity”, “Take him to the
                    loo or he’ll wet his pants”, “Feed him minced
                    food, he cannot chew properly”.
                    Late into midnight, we had retired
                    to bed. I was wide awake and unable to
                    sleep. That was when I heard faint sounds of
                    movement coming from Grandpa’s bedroom.
                    I rushed to his room.
                    There he was, woken up and
                    approaching Grandma’s side. He moved very
                    slowly, inching forward with the help of his
                    tripod stick that he’d diffidently use in front
                    of everyone. I watched him silently as he
                    sat beside her pillow, slowly and firmly. He
                    laced his hand over her forehead and started
                    humming a soft tune. I remained a silent
                    spectator, like the bed and the mirror, invisible
                    to him. It was inconceivable to imagine him
                    get up on his own at such a stage, recalling
                    what effort it takes us to help him out of
                    the chair every day. Those stern muscles
                    just wouldn’t move, no matter how much he
                    tried. That incredible night, I witnessed a feat
                    of love - a tender, delectable moment that
                    showed love triumphs over everything.

            <div class="coll2">
                <div>I had tears in my eyes, laughing at
                    some perverse comment that my friend had
                    made along with my other vagabond friends
                    who were chilling on the beach with me.
                    I was sprawled like a starfish on the sand
                    without caring about the fact that my mom
                    would probably bite my ear off for dirtying
                    my newly washed jeans.
                    We had to stop goofing around for
                    some time, as a kid around 10 years old
                    approached within hearing distance. That kid
                    would probably have been scandalized as our
                    talks needed PG(Parental Guidance). As we
                    stared at him as if he was an extraterrestrial
                    being flying a UFO (just joking), he lost his
                    concentration and stared back at us with
                    curious cautious eyes forgetting about his
                    kite that flew away. Disheartened, he stared
                    at us and then back at his kite drifting away.
                    My sweet friend chatted with him
                    and took him to buy a kite. Looking at the
                    two chat like long lost friends and walking
                    away, brought a smile to my face. (What?
                    Don’t judge. It was a cute thing to do okay).
                    Reminiscing my good old childhood days
                    I slipped away from a world of Techmax,
                    software development project and all that
                    jazz that engineers keep thinking about, into
                    a world of, toe curling laughter watching
                    Jerry beat Tom repeatedly, mischievous
                    smiles after stealing candy from the fridge
                    and where making something out of legos
                    was an accomplishment. (Sighs)
                    I was brought out of my stupor by the
                    two desolate boys walking towards us with
                    forlorn expressions. The kite seller had left
                    for the day and now they were left without
                    a kite. Seeing the kid in tears, we asked him
                    what he would like to eat. He pointed towards
                    the gola walla saying he’d love to have a
                    ‘chammach gola’ (his words, not mine). We
                    went towards the gola walla and stood by
                    the side chatting while he was preparing the
                    gola for him.
                    All this while, the kid looked at the
                    gola like his prized possession, mesmerized
                    by the way the crushed pieces of ice were
                    put together to form his ‘chammach gola’.
                    The sparkle in his eyes and the way he
                    opened his mouth and then closed it, gaping
                    at the glass in front of him that the maker
                    of the masterpiece had set in front of him,
                    was magical. The “thank you didi” that
                    came from him didn’t reach my ears as I was
                    dumbfounded thinking about how a gola
                    that cost 30 rupees could make someone so
                    happy. A gola!
                    Later that night when I was making a
                    list of all the tasks for the next day, I wrote
                    down the saying “Carpe Diem” at the end
                    of the page. Seize the day! How ironic! I’m
                    sure at some point everyone has written this
                    phrase down only to shred it into pieces by
                    the end of the day, to vent some frustration
                    of the entire day. The clock ticks every second
                    and the pressure cooker whistles every time
                    you make a wrong move telling you that
                    you’re not going to like the end result. And
                    in the meantime, the mantra “Carpe Diem”
                    feels like nothing but a sheer mockery of
                    our robotic lives. We are running in this
                    race of getting a 10 pointer, semester
                    after semester. Doing an internship,
                    getting into the best companies
                    and finally getting married.
                    To do what? Finding that
                    euphoric feeling that will
                    be our own Kairotic moment? But will this
                    race ever end?
                    The happiness that shone in that kid’s
                    eyes as bright as the Kohinoor taught me
                    a lesson. It’s not about the entire day; it is
                    not just about having everything. It’s about
                    making something worthwhile out of the little
                    things you’ve done. It’s not about seizing
                    the entire day but it is about seizing a few
                    moments worth treasuring that will help you
                    get through the entire day.
                    So rather than Carpe Diem...
                    Carpe a few Kairoi every day!

                    -Charles Darwin<br/>
                    Charles Darwin, Walt Disney, Isaac
                    Newton, Thomas Edison, Albert Einstein and
                    many other successful personalities faced a
                    lot of criticism during their formative years.
                    But those criticisms did not bring down
                    their zeal or their thirst for success. It rather
                    motivated them to prove their worth to
                    the many critics around them which is why
                    they are remembered even today for their
                    successful inventions.
                    Why talk about the past? People today
                    as well, are faced with a lot of criticism.
                    Be it a student who hasn’t been able
                    to successfully get through a medical
                    entrance and chooses something
                    else instead of the medical
                    stream, or even people
                    who haven’t been able to achieve something are
                    always talked about by society.
                    But setting all of this aside, what is
                    more important is that the individual
                    who at first had given up due to his failures,
                    now decides to sit back, think, ponder and
                    get set for a new adventure that is still yet to
                    come. The ultimate decision for taking that
                    one step towards a new future rests only on
                    that one individual. One has to think about
                    the new road that has suddenly appeared
                    and how one can make the best of it. One
                    needs to collect one’s thoughts and get
                    ready to move onto something that involves
                    change, something that involves transition—
                    from old thoughts to something completely
                    new. No matter what obstacles life has given
                    him in the past, the individual who is on this
                    new journey needs to forget the past, learn
                    from it and step ahead with conviction, but
                    this time with more enthusiasm.
                    Considering the new path now! When
                    one decides to move on with the new way
                    that has opened up, there comes a time when
                    one is half way through to achieve that new
                    goal. At that time when the individual puts on
                    his thinking cap to really compare situations
                    of the past and the present, the individual
                    realizes that this path has really brought
                    something good, this path was something
                    that was destined, this was something
                    really planned to happen in his life. Now
                    this individual is quite content with what he
                    has achieved till date. No matter how far an
                    individual moves on or how much he achieves
                    in life, there is always that one moment when
                    he looks back to wonder why whatever
                    happened led him to taking a new step.
                    This is what you call, “Living a Kairos
                    Life in a Chronos world.” We should always
                    live our days looking for those moments,
                    those inexplicable times when God’s will and
                    his ways intersect our daily walks of
                    life. And trust me, this could happen
                    anytime! A friend could call you out of
                    the blue and give you a good word or a
                    colleague could take a moment aside and
                    lend you a hand. God is always surprising
                    us with His perfect, kairos time. But are we
                    willing to embrace the occasion?

            <div class="english-title">NEW YEAR RESOLUTION</div>
            <div class="coll2">
                <div>Days, weeks, months and years go by;
                    time is flying. Every year, we think, plan and
                    make resolutions for the coming year for it to
                    be great, memorable, full of joy and so that it
                    fulfills our dreams. However, everyone feels
                    the need to limit these resolutions to their
                    feasibility and completeness. Resolutions can
                    be as small as ‘throwing wrappers/plastics in
                    dustbins’, ’restricting ourselves from spitting
                    on the road’, ‘avoiding the use of abusive
                    language’, ‘following traffic rules’, etc.
                    Positive attitude and energy is what
                    we need to give more emphasis to. We need
                    to nurture the good qualities required in an
                    individual. The same is nicely described by the
                    famous Marathi writer P. K. Atre in this stanza:
                    “Deh devaache mandir jashi usaat ho
                    saakhar tasa dehat Parmeshwar”
                    God resides in every individual; to
                    elaborate this, he has given us an example
                    of sugarcane from which sugar is extracted.
                    The Lord resides in every person with some
                    good qualities. Godliness can be shown to
                    the society by carrying out initiatives for
                    certain social causes which help the poor and
                    downtrodden.
                    Another very important aspect which
                    we should be aware of is that we should never
                    be egoistic. One should be proud of what he
                    has achieved but should not be flattered by
                    it. One can achieve laurels in his life but he
                    still needs to be simple. Again, let me take
                    the help of a famous line from the Abhanga:
                    “ Maati bole kumbhaaraala ka paayee
                    tudavishi,
                    tuzaach aahe shevat vedya maazhya
                    paayashi”
                    However big an individual might
                    become, he has to realize that he has been
                    raised from soil and will ultimately return to
                    the same soil. Whatever your achievements,
                    the destination of every life is death. We
                    are sent to the earth for some specific
                    tasks and we need to strive to attain them.
                    It is not you but your works which will last
                    forever. For youngsters, it is very necessary
                    to show perseverance and diligence to
                    achieve the goals set for them in the fields
                    of education, technology, sports, culture,
                    etc. The line by a Gyanpeeth award winning
                    Marathi writer says everything about it:
                    “Vaasantik mand pavnaane aandolit
                    zhaalelyaa mandaar manjirichyaa bhovati
                    madhugunjarava
                    karnaarya milindapramane maanasachi
                    manovrutti asaavi”
                    One needs to be focused like a
                    honeybee and always be in search of
                    something that will add value to one’s career.
                    If we stick to the basics and follow our

            <div class="english-title">BLISSFULLY IGNORANT</div>
            <div class="coll2">
                <div>It was a Sunday evening and one of our
                    routinely visits to the Siddhivinayak temple.
                    My family and I had just joined the incredibly
                    long queue that snaked its way into the
                    temple’s sanctum. The line grew steadily as
                    we paced forward, inch by inch, restlessly,
                    hoping we’d make it quick till the entrance.
                    The temple’s compound held numerous stalls,
                    all of them selling laddus and other sweets,
                    garlands and other merchandise. We bought
                    a garland and a plate of ‘offerings’ at one of
                    the stalls before entering the line.
                    A while later and deeper into the
                    queue, I noticed a thin, young girl holding a
                    basket of garlands coming towards the queue.
                    She wore a ragged frock of fading pink. She
                    approached random people in the crowd to
                    sell garlands, but most of us had one and
                    would turn down her offer. I watched her as she
                    hopped over the red tiles, carefully avoiding
                    the yellow ones as they alternately dressed
                    the floor. Her foot stopped beside mine.
                    “Didi, mala Bhagwaan ke liye”, she
                    showed me her basket of garlands. I politely
                    refused.
                    “Ok didi, nexsht time!” she winked
                    and turned away, proceeding further, into the
                    black of the night. Would the girl hop the red
                    tiles the same way selling her garlands years
                    later? I wondered.
                    Children are so blissfully ignorant.
                    Having stepped into adulthood, all of us
                    begin looking at life through different
                    colored glasses—sometimes red and
                    frustrated, sometimes blue and somber,
                    yellow and bright or grey and dull. Time
                    isn’t playtime anymore. Not all men
                    are good uncles or women good
                    aunties. We finally come to realize and understand the
                    world. Our shoulders become
                    heavy with responsibilities as we
                    blend ourselves into the mundaneness
                    of work life. We work to earn, earn to live.
                    We work and work, and eagerly anticipate
                    the weekend holidays. And once they’re
                    spent, wait a long way until the next. We
                    forget to cherish life as we live. Life’s no
                    longer a wonderland, and reality tugs at our
                    shoulders.
                    Yet, it isn’t a bad idea to get blissfully
                    ignorant once in a while and dance our way
                    through wonderland, carefully hopping over
                    just the red tiles, leaving the yellows...Nay?

            <div class="coll3">
                <div>In the summer of 2015, I was in the
                    U.S. for a few weeks. During my brief stay,
                    I was privileged to visit the campuses of two
                    leading members of the Ivy League, namely
                    Princeton and Harvard. ‘Ivy League’ is a
                    collective name for the 8 Private Universities
                    located in the North Eastern States of the
                    U.S. that are known for their high quality
                    education and research. These are:

                    These eight universities are

                    for young and aspiring minds anywhere
                    in the world. But it is very tough to get

                    Moreover,the Ivy League is expensive.
                    Many meritorious students aroundthe world
                    cannot afford the cost that can be anywhere
                    between 160000 – 200000 US$ for a 4-year
                    UG programme.
                    Thus,the Ivy League is beyond reach
                    for students from the middle class or lower
                    middle class. In a sense,the Ivy League is not
                    only a hall mark of world class education and
                    research but is also a symbol of social elitism.
                    However, my visit to these two
                    campuses was incredibly exhilarating and
                    awe inspiring. These are creations of many
                    innovative minds and fruits of selfless work
                    by many dedicated souls to give the world an
                    experience of great learning and motivation
                    for original work in any field of knowledge.
                    Here is a campus of emerging minds that
                    endeavour to follow the motto of the
                    university: Light and Truth.
                    Long live the Ivy League.

                    I was left without a clue<br/>
                    Didn’t know the next thing left to do<br/>
                    Staring blankly at the cloudy sky<br/>
                    I didn’t think we’d ever say goodbye<br/>
                    I just came here to meet you<br/>
                    Can’t hold my tears anymore<br/>
                    You swore you would always stay<br/>
                    You said that you’d never go away<br/>
                    I think of our time together<br/>
                    And for a minute I do feel better<br/>
                    But then it comes pouring back in<br/>
                    Gripping my throat, I can’t breathe<br/>
                    All the promises you never kept<br/>
                    I’m left alone standing at your grave<br/>
                    I’m broken in two, do you even know?<br/>
                    Oh tell me, did you really have to go?<br/>
                    Just then my tears hit the gravestone<br/>
                    And I look down at the roses I left you<br/>
                    They’re still fresh and beaming red<br/>
                    Scarcely haunted by the dead<br/>
                    It felt as if they’re looking at me<br/>
                    As if they’re smiling, smiling lovingly<br/>
                    That’s when it struck me<br/>
                    And that was the moment I knew<br/>
                    You’re gone but you’re not really gone<br/>
                    Maybe in a better place but never far<br/>
                    You’re right there watching over me<br/>
                    I know you’re smiling, smiling lovingly<br/>
                    And that moment was enough to keep me going on<br/></div>

                    It all starts like a flash in my mind<br/>
                    Out of nowhere my mind does suddenly find<br/>
                    An idea to express this time<br/>
                    And make it more gripping with some words to rhyme<br/>
                    Permutations and combinations begin from then<br/>
                    Finding the correct words becomes hectic again<br/>
                    Collecting pieces of experiences<br/>
                    Going down the memory lane<br/>
                    Slowly and gradually it becomes long<br/>
                    The words moving to places where they belong<br/>
                    Sometimes the words come rather slow<br/>
                    While sometimes they are in full flow<br/>
                    After some challenging brainstorming sessions<br/>
                    I finally arrive at a line of conclusion<br/>
                    What started out as an idea in my mind<br/>
                    Now is a full bunch of words to bind<br/></div>

                    Your words make me kneel<br/>
                    With awe and wonder<br/>
                    Your words make me weep<br/>
                    Like no other<br/>
                    Your words, sometimes subtle<br/>
                    Always find the right niche<br/>
                    Your words, when they’re loud<br/>
                    Are always when you’re proud<br/>
                    Your words can be sardonic<br/>
                    But only to a special few<br/>
                    Who think they are an ocean<br/>
                    When they’re only a drop of dew<br/>
                    Your words are never grey<br/>
                    This adds to their might<br/>
                    They teach me, why to hide<br/>
                    What will eventually come to light<br/>
                    Your words that never waver<br/>
                    As strong as the sun<br/>
                    They carry a sense of altruism<br/>
                    In all that’s said and done<br/>
                    Your words can do wonders<br/>
                    Your words know no bounds<br/>
                    Your words are so powerful<br/>
                    They can turn the world around<br/>
                    People seek you for your words<br/>
                    That upholds your unfaltering justice<br/>
                    Knowing that you will be forthright<br/>
                    In condoning as well as condemning<br/>
                    Your words always find me<br/>
                    In the darkest of times<br/>
                    Surely to make me see<br/>
                    That that is also a form of light<br/>
                    Your words bear your spirit<br/>
                    A kind but fiery flame<br/>
                    Ready to guide the world<br/>
                    Towards bliss, untamed!<br/></div>

                    about almost anything there is, it is hard to fathom ways in which incredible advancements in
                    technology have transformed our lives.
                    Artificial General Intelligence, Virtual Reality, Nanotech computing, electric
                    avenues are dreams today which could be a part of our daily lives in the next 50
                    or 5 years. This exponential technological expansion will always
                    leave us with one question; is it for better or worse?
                    As we leave you to ponder on that, we, the technical editors of
                    FragMag 2016 take immense pleasure to invite you to
                    turn the pages of the technical section that look further
                    into the innovations that will define our future.

                <div>Anyone with their fingers even
                    remotely close to the pulse of gaming knows
                    that e-sports have blown up in popularity
                    over the past few years. With thousands of
                    gamers competing and millions watching,
                    the phenomenon has come a long way in a
                    very short period of time. A recent world
                    championship of DotA 2, the International,
                    had a prize pool of 18 million USD and had
                    peak time viewership of 8.5 million, beating
                    the 8.1 million views of the GoT Season
                    5 finale. It is baffling to even imagine a
                    videogame, which involves moving little
                    wizards around on the screen, commanding
                    such respect.
                    I started playing DotA as a hobby. Now
                    after nearly 1600 hours of game play over 18
                    months, it has become an intractable part of
                    the fabric of my life as a twenty-something. I
                    couldn’t stop playing it without compromising
                    dozens of friendships, opportunities and so
                    on. If I started out thinking of DotA 2 as a
                    complicated video game and moved on to
                    thinking of it as a form of performance, I now
                    think of it almost exclusively as a sport. Much
                    of what I used to understand as creative or
                    social challenges- getting 5 people to work
                    in harmony with one another, experimenting
                    with the opportunities afforded by the hero
                    pool- I now think of in terms of organized
                    competition and self improvement. DotA 2
                    isn’t a toy box anymore; it’s a test. It’s as wall
                    to be climbed, an encounter with a system
                    that demands respect and doesn’t owe you
                    anything.
                    While playing the game is entertaining,
                    that’s no longer the reason I do it.
                    I play DotA to get better at DotA;
                    to learn something, alone or with my
                    friends, and to apply that understanding
                    over and over again in a dozen different
                    configurations. Play is practice, and practice
                    is both gratifying an utterly, mood-crushingly
                    frustrating. It’s a fundamentally different
                    approach to games than what is considered
                    to be ‘mainstream’ or ‘normal’. One may note
                    that this is not altogether different from what
                    a player playing a classic sport undergoes.
                    There’s a lot about my time with DotA
                    that has made me question my place in the
                    gaming community. It’s a toxic environment
                    often, and there have been points where
                    it really does feel just like being a rat
                    fighting another rat for a go on the ‘treat’
                    button. Despite this, the mass appeal of
                    serious competition-of games as sports, as
                    collectively owned hobbies that you engage
                    in because they test you, gives me faith in
                    gaming as a whole.
                    Wanting to get better at something is
                    a very basic and very human drive, one that
                    is diminished whenever somebody argues
                    that the ‘average’ player just wants to be
                    entertained. The great thing about taking a
                    game seriously is that it proves that attitude
                    wrong; not just in terms of what it says
                    about the games industry, but in terms of
                    what it says about people. People, it turns
                    out, are very good at learning and working
                    hard and, from time to time, at cooperating.
                    DotA is no longer important to me because it
                    represents a performance of personal traits;
                    it’s important to me because it represents a
                    performance of these universal ones.

                    For anyone who’s ever coded or made
                    any project, the above naming convention
                    would be familiar. How many times have we
                    renamed, copied, and edited the same code
                    to implement some new idea or algorithm, or
                    just for the sake of posterity? Is there a more
                    efficient way of doing the same? Adding a
                    new idea or taking a backup, but tracking the
                    changes done to the file, at the same time, by
                    different users? Yes. Using Version Control.
                    Version Control, also known as source
                    control or revision control, is the ability to
                    track changes to files made by different
                    programs/users, preferably with timestamps.
                    Each change is uniquely identifiable, so that
                    the user can revert back to an older version of
                    the file, or branch the code entirely, to make
                    some changes, and if required, merge back
                    with the original code. This is an incredibly
                    useful tool, not only for individuals, but also
                    for collaborative editing, where many users
                    can contribute to a public project by creating
                    their own branches. This is the backbone of
                    open source software.
                    There are many version control tools
                    available like Git, SVN, CVS, Mercurial etc.
                    The most popular and widely used is Git,
                    developed by Linus Torvalds, creator
                    of the Linux kernel. Unlike traditional
                    version control software, which
                    requires a server running the central
                    repository, each Git folder is a fullfledged
                    repository with complete
                    history and full version-tracking capabilities,
                    independent of network access or a central
                    server. You don’t even require internet to
                    make Git work, as long as you have access to
                    the local repository; Git will continue tracking
                    changes. Even if you start working on a
                    different computer, but with the same Git
                    folder, Git will provide the entire file history
                    with every change made. Git is used by a
                    variety of software companies like Yahoo,
                    Quora, Twitter, eBay & Google. It is also
                    the recommended version control system
                    at Amazon and Apple. It can be used by IT
                    and COMPUTER students in their projects. In
                    fact, popular IDEs like IntelliJ, Visual Studio
                    etc. have integrated version control plugins.
                    Production & Electronics students can use
                    SVN to track their projects as SVN is better at
                    handling binary files like SolidWorks designs/
                    Eagle PCB desgins compared to Git.
                    In conclusion, I would like to say that
                    Version Control should be comprehensively
                    taught to all undergrads, as it is increasingly
                    being used by all major software companies.
                    Version control is an essential skill that will
                    help us efficiently write and track a code.

            <div class="coll2">
                <div>ASTROSAT is the first dedicated Indian
                    astronomy mission aimed at studying
                    distant celestial objects. The mission is
                    capable of performing observations in
                    Ultraviolet (UV), optical, low and high energy
                    X-ray wavebands at the same time. The
                    satellite is planned to be launched on 28th
                    September 2015 by PSLV C-30 to a 650 km
                    near equatorial orbit around the Earth.
                    ASTROSAT carries four X-ray payloads
                    (Scientific Instruments), one UV telescope and
                    a charge article monitor. Apart from ISRO, four
                    other Indian institutions, viz., Tata Institute of
                    Fundamental Research TIFR), Indian Institute
                    of Astrophysics (IIA), Inter-University Centre
                    for Astronomy and Astrophysics (IUCAA) and
                    Raman Research Institute (RRI) are involved
                    in payload development.
                    ASTROSAT will carry five astronomy payloads
                    for simultaneous multi-band observations:
                    1. Twin 40-cm Ultraviolet Imaging Telescopes
                    (UVIT) covering Far-UV to optical bands.
                    2. Three units of Large Area X-Ray Proportional
                    Counters (LAXPC) covering medium energy
                    X-rays from 3 to 80 keV with an effective area
                    of 6000 sq.cm. at 10 keV.
                    3. A Soft X-ray Telescope (SXT) with conical
                    foil mirrors and X-ray CCD detector, covering
                    the energy range 0.3-8 keV. The effective
                    area will be about 120 sq.cm. at 1 keV.
                    4. A Cadmium-Zinc-Telluride coded-mask
                    imager (CZTI), covering hard X-rays from 10
                    to 150 keV, with about 10 deg field of view
                    and 500 sq.cm. effective area.
                    5. A Scanning Sky Monitor (SSM)
                    consisting of three one-dimensional
                    position-sensitive proportional counters
                    with coded masks. The assembly will be
                    placed on a rotating platform to scan the
                    available sky once every six hours in order to
                    locate transient X-ray sources.
                    ASTROSAT will be a proposal-driven general
                    purpose observatory, with main scientific
                    focus on:
                    1. Simultaneous multi-wavelength monitoring
                    of intensity variations in a broad range of
                    cosmic sources.
                    2. Monitoring the X-ray sky for new transients.
                    3. Sky surveys in the hard X-ray and UV bands.
                    4. Broadband spectroscopic studies of X-ray
                    binaries, AGN, SNRs, clusters of galaxies and
                    stellar coronae.
                    5. Studies of periodic and non-periodic
                    variability of X-ray sources.
                    Proposal-driven means anyone can
                    submit their proposal for observation of
                    interested sources, QPO, transients, black
                    hole, Clusters using interested payload
                    at any inclination in any orbit on any day.
                    Depending on the excellence of the proposal
                    it will be accepted or rejected by the science
                    committee.
                    Payloads (scientific Instruments
                    mounted on satellite deck) needs to undergo
                    several environmental qualification tests at
                    various test facilities. The level of tests is
                    pre-determined by QA officer after analysing
                    payloads maximum operating range and
                    environmental parameters of mission. Tests
                    carried out are:
                    1. Vibration Test: Vibration tests are carried
                    out to determine that designed system can
                    withstand rigors of vibrations in its intended
                    use environment. Tests carried out in
                    Vibration Lab are of much higher level than
                    the vibrations actually felt during the rocket
                    launch. Vibration tests are carried out in three
                    mechanical axes X-Axis, Y-Axis and Z-Axis .
                    Payload is mounted on mechanical structure
                    which is mounted on Vibration Table.
                    Accelerometers and sensors are used to
                    determine payloads vibration characteristics.
                    2. Thermovac Test: Thermovac test
                    demonstrate performance and survival under
                    temperature variations in vacuum condition,
                    which exceed predicted flight temperature
                    levels. Thermovac test is done immediately
                    after vibration test.
                    Payload needs to perform as per their design
                    in span of short and long Hot and Cold cycles
                    continuously in hard vacuum state. For e.g. If
                    a payloads operating range in Space is from
                    10° to 30° the Thermovac test performed will
                    have five short cycles of 2hrs each ranging
                    from -5 ° to 40 ° and two long cycles of 24hrs
                    soak at -5 ° and 40 ° temperature as per QA
                    guidance.
                    3. EMI/EMC Test: EMI/EMC stands
                    for Electromagnetic Interference and
                    Electromagnetic conductance. The EMI/EMC
                    test ensures that the total payload performs
                    its intended functions when operating in the
                    predicted electromagnetic environment.
                    The test regime is composed of a variety
                    of conducted and radiated emissions, as
                    well as susceptibility tests with both
                    being steady-state and transient
                    in nature. EMI/EMC tests ensure
                    that payloads are compatible
                    with itself, electronic noise
                    emissions, self-generated
                    RF transmissions from antennas, and cross
                    coupling of electrical currents.
                    4. Calibration: All the Payloads in the satellite
                    are scientifically designed, so they need to
                    be calibrated with X-Ray Sources like Am241,
                    Fe55, Cd109... available at ground in-order
                    to set reference data set.
                    After qualifying all the tests payloads
                    undergo Baking and then they are cleared for
                    mounting on satellite deck. Baking is done
                    in Thermovac chamber at a fix temperature
                    to minimise contamination and outgasing.
                    Baking is a passive test and no live tests are
                    performed during baking. Witness mirrors
                    are used to determine contamination level of
                    package.
                    Satellite Assembly: Satellite assembly
                    is done in AIT (Assembly, Integration and
                    Testing) Room. AIT is a big clean room where
                    a low level of environmental pollutants such
                    as dust, airborne microbes, aerosol particles,
                    and chemical vapours are present.
                    Satellite Assembly Testing is carried in three
                    phases in AIT room:
                    Open End Testing: In this phase the initial
                    harnessing (Wiring) is verified and it is
                    assured that NO shorting exists between
                    any two wires. Harnessing is done as per
                    EID (Electrical Instrument Document) and
                    commands are issued and their levels are
                    measured on CRO.
                    Close End Testing: Once open end testing is
                    found satisfactory harnesses are connected
                    to their respective packages (as per
                    their tagging) and close end testing of
                    packages is performed to check for
                    any variations in any electrical and
                    science parameters.
                    After clearance from
                    all Payloads and Packages
                    (Packages are common electronic
                    units for all satellites viz. BMU, BDR,
                    Antennas,
                    Power subsystem...) full level satellite
                    mounting is carried out. Satellite mounting
                    is done panel by panel. Once all panels are
                    mounted satellite is cleared for full level
                    satellite assembly testing. Thermal blankets
                    are mounted as per thermal
                    requirement. Thermal Blanket provides
                    package with desired thermal level for
                    operation.
                    Full Satellite Assembly Testing: In this
                    testing phase all payloads and packages are
                    turned ON together as they are designed
                    to perform in space and checks are done
                    for any anomalies in commands issued, data
                    reception, electrical and science parameters
                    of Payloads and Packages.
                    Full level assembled satellite undergoes EMIEMC
                    test, Thermovac test, Vibration and
                    Acoustic tests before shipment to Sriharikota.
                    Astrosat Satellite was mounted on
                    fourth stage PSLV rocket C-30. PSLV stands
                    for The Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle. The
                    satellite is launched on 28th September 2015
                    by PSLV C-30 to a 650 km near equatorial
                    orbit around the Earth. Rockets are named D
                    in initial stages e.g. PSLV D1 where D stands
                    for Development. Once their performance
                    is satisfactory it is renamed as C indicating
                    Commercial e.g. PSLV C-30.
                    On the PSLV first stage thrust is
                    augmented by six strap-on solid boosters.
                    Four boosters are ground-lit and the
                    remaining two ignite 25 seconds after launch.
                    In the standard PSLV, each booster carries
                    nine tonnes of propellant and produces
                    510 kN thrust. The PSLV has four
                    stages using solid and liquid propulsion
                    systems alternately. Vikas engine built by
                    Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO)
                    is used in the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle
                    (PSLV) and the Geosynchronous Satellite
                    Launch Vehicle (GSLV) series. The engine is
                    used as the second stage of both the PSLV
                    and the GSLV launch vehicles, with four
                    strap-on boosters. The satellite is injected
                    and parked in the Final stage.
                    I conclude this article congratulating
                    ISRO, Indian Scientists and Everyone who
                    gave his valuable contribution to make this
                    project a success.

            <div class="coll2">
                <div>The future of data storage is a pretty
                    ironic problem. Huge amounts of data is
                    generated each day by people, we’re yet to
                    find a way to preserve this deluge of data that
                    works better than the cave man approach of
                    carving messages onto walls.
                    When you’re talking about hundreds,
                    thousands, or millions of years, the shelf-life
                    of our personal data is a mere flash. Current
                    data storage methods don’t last beyond
                    a few decades, which have storage media
                    users worried about the integrity of their
                    data. To solve this, scientists are working on a
                    method to store data cheaply and reliably for
                    the long haul. All research has led to only one
                    conclusion, the best method for backing up
                    and archiving the information superhighway
                    is old-school, nearly antiquated magnetic
                    tape. Yup, your old cassettes and VHS tapes
                    are coming back.
                    Extracting data from a tape is about
                    four times as fast as reading from a hard disk
                    ... The second advantage is reliability. When
                    a tape snaps, it can be spliced back together.
                    The loss is rarely more than a few hundred
                    megabytes. When a terabyte hard disk fails,
                    by contrast, all the data on it may be lost.
                    The third benefit of tapes is that they do not
                    need power to preserve data held on them. It
                    is cheaper than disks, and lasts longer. Tapes
                    can still be read reliably after three decades,
                    against five years for disks. Sony released
                    a 185 terabyte magnetic tape drive for
                    consumers in 2014 while IBM announced that
                    they have figured out a way to have a 220
                    terabyte magnetic tape drive, all this while
                    maintaining a compact size. So why not use it
                    instead of hard disks or solid state drives you
                    ask?
                    Well the downside of magnetic
                    tape drives is their slow access times since
                    accessing a particular data on it means
                    winding the tape compared to hard drives or
                    solid state drives. This is the reason magnetic
                    tape drives are used only to store ‘cold
                    data’ i.e. data which isn’t accessed a lot like
                    backups.
                    So the next time you buy storage remember
                    these until storage technology advances:
                    Reliability + Maximum storage = Magnetic
                    tape drives
                    Value for money = Hard Disk Drive
                    High data transfer speed = Solid State
                    Drive
                    Getting back to long-term data
                    storage, researchers working on
                    the Human Document Project
                    are experimenting with
                    preserving data via QR
                    codes etched into
                    tungsten, coated in silicon nitride. With
                    a similar target, Japanese researchers
                    developed a prototype of a system that uses
                    quartz crystal that they claim can preserve
                    data for 300 million years.
                    To a certain extent all this will help
                    future generations know much more about
                    the current generation than we know about
                    our past. Long term storage is the only way
                    the technology driven world we live in keeps
                    moving forward…

            <div class="english-title">COMPRESSED AIR CAR</div>
            <div class="coll2">
                <div>Work on compressed air engine
                    started in 1979. French scientist, Guy Negre,
                    developed compressed air 4-cyclinder
                    engine, for cars, that could run on both air
                    and gasoline, in 1988. Since then, many
                    modifications and changes have been
                    made to improvise on its efficiency and
                    performance. Compressed air car is one of
                    the best innovations that can serve as an
                    alternate for fuel, for the future, causing no
                    pollution.
                    Compressed air car works on the principle
                    of compressed air to drive its mo-tors. It can
                    either be powered solely with air or it can be
                    combined with gasoline, diesel or electrical
                    plant. Engines powered by compressed air
                    drives the piston us-ing the expansion of
                    compressed air rather than ignited air-fuel
                    mixture. The ve-hicle’s accelerator operates
                    a valve on the tank which allows the
                    compressed air to flow into the engine,
                    where the pressure of air’s expansion
                    pushes the pistons and thereby
                    turns the crank shaft. This will
                    produce enough power
                    for speed of 56kmph.
                    When the car surpasses that
                    speed, a motor will operate the
                    in-car compressor so it can compress
                    more air and provide extra power to
                    the engine. The air heats up as it hits the
                    engine, increasing its volume, allowing the
                    car to move faster. These storage tanks are
                    made up of rigid and robust materials like
                    Carbon fiber which helps reduce weight; if
                    penetrated Carbon fiber will crack but won’t
                    produce shrapnel. These tanks can sustain
                    air pressure up to 4500 psi, mak-ing them
                    comparable to steel tanks. Compressed
                    air cars are emission free at the exhaust as
                    electricity is usually the source of energy. It
                    also depends on how clean is this source of
                    electricity.
                    Availability of the source is not an
                    issue as air is a natural resource and is freely
                    available in the atmosphere and can be stored
                    at desired pressure. The list of ad-vantages
                    for compressed air car engine seems to be
                    never ending.
                    Air is renewable energy, it can
                    replace gasoline and diesel, it can reduce
                    global warming gas emission, it is non toxic
                    and environmental friendly, are some of
                    its advantages. It also reduces the overall
                    production cost as it does not require spark
                    plugs, starter motor and a cooling system. It
                    does have its own disadvantages but they are
                    overshadowed by the more than satisfying
                    results it helps to achieve.
                    In conclusion, compressed air car is the
                    next future and the best alternate to the
                    fossil fuel driven engines.

                A CROSS LAYER DESIGN METHODOLOGY
                FOR EFFICIENT WIRELESS
                COMMUNICATION
            </div>
            <div class="coll2">
                <div>In the LLECLAIR, ÉCLAIR protocol
                    works on the sender and receiver extreme
                    ends it does the job of combining two or
                    more layers and implements the cross layer
                    design method. In between sender and
                    receiver LLCLAMP protocols plays a major
                    role of sending and receiving of the data.
                    The proposed protocol exhibits the similar
                    way of communication as LLCLAMP does
                    .i.e., the acknowledgement at the receiver
                    is suppressed and is generated at the base
                    station. The congestion measure is also
                    calculated at the base station and is attached
                    with the acknowledgement.
                    Initially the layer which are to be used
                    for providing the communication are decided
                    by the user then once it has been selected at
                    the sender and receiver’s end this layers are
                    merge using the ÉCLAIR protocol . ÉCLAIR
                    provides an efficient mechanism to merge
                    two or more layers. Tuning Layer provides
                    flexibility for the connection between two or
                    more layers. The purpose of the tuning layer
                    is to provide a interface in order to attach
                    layers (actually the functionalities of layers).
                    The optimizing subsystem contains the
                    algorithms and data structures for cross layer
                    optimizations. It is the cross layer engine.
                    The OSS contains many Protocol Optimizers
                    (POs). A PO contains the algorithm for a given
                    cross layer optimization. The OSS executes
                    concurrently with the existing protocol stack
                    and does not increase the stack processing
                    overhead.
                    The design of ECLAIR enables easy
                    deployment and control of cross layer
                    feedback optimizations, enables interaction
                    among multiple protocol stacks and facilitates
                    user feedback.
                    - Event Notification: The TLs provide the
                    facility for POs to register for interesting
                    events at a layer.
                    - Switch on/off : Since the cross layer system
                    is separate, it can be easily/dynamically
                    switched on or off. Also, individual POs may
                    be switched on/off.
                    - Guards: The TLs may implement guards to
                    ensure that a PO does not grossly deviate
                    from the expected protocol behaviour.
                    - Seamless mobility: ECLAIR can be used
                    to enable seamless mobility on the mobile
                    devices through POs that can monitor and
                    control multiple protocol stacks.
                    - User Tuning Layer: Besides the layer
                    specific TLs, ECLAIR also has a User
                    Tuning Layer (UTL). UTL allows a
                    device user or an external entity
                    e.g.: a distributed algorithm
                    or a base station, to tune
                    the device behaviour.
                    Once the Layers are merged that
                    is the cross layer environment is been
                    created using the ÉCLAIR protocol then the
                    LLCLMAP approach is used for performing
                    the communication. The L2CLAMP agent
                    module in the figure suppresses the outgoing
                    L2CLAMP -TCP ACKs at the receiver side and
                    generates them locally at the sender or base
                    station. The basic idea behind approach is to
                    shift TCP ACK generation point from mobile
                    receiver to the base station. L2CLAMP -
                    TCP requires implementation of a software
                    module, called L2CLAMP agent, inside BS /
                    AP protocol stack above the link layer. The
                    L2CLAMP agent sniffs the ingress traffic
                    from the fixed network assuming to have
                    access to the network and transport layer
                    headers. Whenever a TCP data packet
                    is detected, the L2CLAMP Agent
                    in the BS / AP, performs service
                    rate, congestion measurement,
                    received rate and calculates
                    the AWND value, stores flow-related information such
                    as flow sequence number carried
                    by the packet, port numbers, ACK
                    flag and ACK sequence number, along
                    with the AWND value. L2CLAMP agent
                    calculates the desired size of the AWND
                    window based on the values of congestion
                    measure, received rate and RTT.
                    Finally the overall flow can be shown as
                    follows: -

            <div class="coll2">
                <div>Our fingers are the most versatile
                    tools we possess. The ability to use
                    opposable thumbs to grasp objects and
                    precisely control each finger for fine work, is
                    still unmatched by any known species or even
                    machines. Our fingertips possess the highest
                    concentration of touch receptors, making
                    it extremely sensitive to pressure, vibration
                    and texture. Technology has made ample
                    use of this ability with knobs, tactile buttons,
                    touchscreens etc. But the interfaces still seem
                    unintuitive. Imagine being able to increase the
                    volume of your smarphone by just twiddling
                    your fingers? This is exactly what Google’s
                    Advanced Technology & Projects (ATAP) aims
                    to do, with their innovative Project Soli.
                    Project Soli aims at creating an
                    interaction sensor which can track minute
                    motions at high speed & accurately using
                    radar. It can be fabricated into a very small
                    integrated chip and can be embedded
                    into everyday consumer electronics like
                    smartphones. It works very much like a
                    traditional radar design, it emits radio waves
                    directed towards an object and the reflected
                    waves are processed to calculate the position
                    & velocity of the object in 3D space. However,
                    the Soli sensor is designed to track objects in
                    a narrow region, but with very high degree of
                    accuracy. This was achieved by using Google’s
                    indigenously developed Gesture Recognition
                    Pipeline, where each stage is designed to
                    extract specific gesture information from
                    the received signals. Traditional finger
                    tracking systems making use of either image
                    processing or tracking markers suffer from
                    many problems such as varying lighting
                    conditions, object interference. But radar can propagate through metal too, making it
                    easier to embed the Soli sensor in everyday
                    objects. Google has pushed the limit on the
                    digital processing capabilities of today’s
                    processors to accurately track the finger at
                    sub millimetre range. Google is now putting
                    together an alpha version developer kit &
                    a software API of the Soli sensor. A select
                    group of developers will be provided this kit
                    to create new interactions and applications.
                    Once the alpha and beta stage testing is
                    done, the sensor will be released to OEMs to
                    include it in their products.
                    Project Soli heralds a new era of
                    gesture controlled computing. Combined
                    with other Google ATAP projects like Tango
                    (Augmented Reality) & Jacquard (Electronic
                    Fabrics), Google aims to revolutionize the
                    human machine interaction technology with
                    smarter & natural gesture recognition. The
                    future is indeed here, within our fingertips.

                STORY OF TWO FORGOTTEN
                ENTREPRENEURS
            </div>
            <div class="coll2">
                <div>It was October 1938, in a rented room
                    above a bar in New York. Chestor Carlson was
                    striving to achieve some significant results on
                    his experiments. This struggle of his would
                    soon revolutionize the world.
                    His assistant Otto had a freshly
                    prepared sulphur coating on a zinc plate.
                    On a glass slide Otto wrote the date
                    and the place ‘10-22-38 ASTORIA’
                    using Indian ink. Then with a
                    handkerchief he rubbed the
                    zinc coated plate to apply an
                    electrostatic charge and
                    placed the glass slide over it. Chestor and his
                    assistant shut the windows to make the room
                    as dark as possible and put the combination
                    under a bright incandescent lamp for a
                    few seconds. The slide was taken out and
                    some lycopodium powder was sprinkled
                    over it. By gently blowing on the surface
                    the lose powder was removed and what
                    remained was a near perfect photocopy of
                    the notation ‘10-22-38 ASTORIA’. It was this
                    day that photoelectrography, later known as
                    Xerography or simply Xerox, was invented.
                    Here is the science behind the process.
                    When Otto rubbed the zinc coated sulphur
                    surface with a handkerchief, it induced a
                    positive electric charge on the plate. When
                    the surface was covered with the glass slide
                    and exposed to light, only the positive charges
                    under the ink stayed while the rest got drained
                    (due to photoconductivity). Lycpodium
                    powder consists of negatively charged
                    particles which when sprinkled on the surface
                    adhered to the positively charged area. After
                    blowing, the excess powder was removed
                    and only an image of the print remained.
                    Even though Carlson believed that an
                    office copier could have a remarkable impact
                    on our daily lives, the xerox machine was an
                    innovation that no one wanted back then.
                    Not a single company was willing to invest
                    in his idea. And we were heading towards a
                    world where documentation processes would
                    take ages, engineers would never finish their
                    submissions and stationary shops would
                    never make the kind of profit they do.
                    Finally, after six years a non-profit
                    research organization called Battelle showed
                    some interest. However, things remained
                    sluggish since Battele wasn’t strongly
                    convinced that the product would
                    have a bright future.
                    At the same time,
                    Haloid, a company that manufactured photographic paper had been running into losses after the Second
                    World War. Its revenues were increasing and its earnings were shrinking. Joseph C. Wilson who was
                    leading Haloid at that time believed that the company’s revival depended on profit, profit depended
                    on growth and growth would come with new innovations. Haloid took up Clarkson’s idea and decided to
                    develop it after an agreement with Batelle. For Wilson and his organization this was a big gamble.
                    Investing in a new project when the company was already heading towards a crisis had made it a do or
                    die situation for them.
                    In 1959, twenty one years after Chestor Carlson had developed xerography, Haloid introduced the
                    first convenient office copier. This new technology dramatically altered the industry and started
                    spinning profits for Haloid which was renamed Xerox.
                    Today Xerox is a company with 130,000 employees and 12,000 active patents. Inventions at Xerox Paulo
                    Alto Research Centre (PARC) include the laser printer, Ethernet, computer mouse and many more. The
                    company has spread into fields such as robotics and automation, healthcare, information technology
                    and banking. But only a few know that Xerox is an inspiring story of two forgotten entrepreneurs who
                    had the courage to take the path less travelled and a relentless belief in their purpose.

                    IoT, also known as the Internet of Objects, refers to a wireless network between objects, which are
                    self configuring such as household appliances.
                    What’s more fascinating than the idea that from anytime, anyplace and connectivity for anyone, we
                    will now have connectivity for anything. IoT basically revolves around the three A’s.
                    A: Anytime Connection. A: Anyplace Connection. A: Anything Connection.
                    Ambient intelligence, flexible structures, event driven, complex access technologies and semantic
                    sharing are some of its characteristics. In technical terms, IoT helps us to achieve:
                    • Flexible Configuration.
                    • Universal Transport and Internetworking.
                    • Accessibility and Usability.
                    • Acts as Technology Integrator
                    The basic aim of IoT is to develop a communication between physical world and information world.
                    The IoT Model is made up of Five Layers:
                    • Semantic & Cognitive Computing: Semantic analysis allows you to use artificial intelligence to
                    extract value from your data instead of making only simple predictions.
                    • Forensics and Analytics: Provide intelligence that is beyond simply responding to or conveying an
                    event. Use the collective past to statistically map the future, increasing the ROI from your
                    solution.
                    • Interpret and React: Leverage data from the normalization engine to create business rules,
                    establishing how the system responds at an event level.
                    • Normalization & Engine: Transform data from assets to a common format. This feature enables the
                    sophisticated functionality provided within the subsequent layers.
                    • Connect and Communicate: Enable features such as guaranteed delivery, encryption, chunking and
                    communications format and the communications bridge using any carrier or network.
                    Internet of Things, cloud computing and services are all aspects of a future internet, strength of
                    each CAN AND SHOULD BE COMBINED!
                    But we are definitely at the beginning of an interesting journey.

            <div class="english-title">WHERE IS YIFY?</div>
            <div class="coll2">
                <div>Last year in mid-October, popular movie release group YIFY’s website became unresponsive. For what
                    torrent aficionados thought it was a temporary issue, YIFY was gone for good. The unexpected
                    shutdown marked the end of an era that started at the turn of the decade.
                    YIFY was a Scene group that emerged in the early 2010s when the X264 codec started to gain
                    significant popularity.A Scene group is an underground community of people who specialize in
                    distribution of copyrighted material like TV shows, movies, music, etc. X264 is an open source
                    software which is used to convert videos. Ease of use, and the cornucopia of settings and options it
                    offers makes it a winner amongst other softwares. It is the most widely used codec for mobile
                    devices. The group members were quite deft in using the new X264 codec which gave surprisingly
                    decent file sizes for higher frame sizes on videos. This meant that they can compress a 720p movie
                    into a very low size of 700 megabytes. A movie compressed into 700 MB using an X264 codec will be
                    more visually appealing than compressing a movie to the same size using an XVID codec. Low size
                    means low bit-rate and XVID simply can’t perform well at low bit-rates. This is one of the biggest
                    reasons for YIFY’s popularity.YIFY waits for the movie to be available in Blu-ray versions because
                    using the Blu-ray as a source for conversion gives the best results. Others either release a theatre
                    shoot version or leak a screener copy of the movie which often have very low resolution hence not
                    too appeasing to viewers. Screener copy is that copy which the film maker shares with the censor
                    board or the Awards Jury for evaluation. Pirates often get access to such exclusive stuffs through
                    their connections
                    with industry insiders.
                    Who took YIFI down and how?
                    What is YIFI doing right now?
                    Online piracy is like digital theft.
                    But unlike the conventional theft, there
                    is no police or government organization
                    involved in investigations. So it becomes the
                    responsibility of the film-makers to identify
                    pirates and drag them to court. People
                    involved in online piracy are difficult to trace
                    when there are millions of users sharing pieces
                    of the entire movie. The users and groups
                    involved often belong to different countries
                    around the globe. Because of these reasons,
                    movie industries around the world have
                    organizations, who watch over the internet
                    to curb piracy. Motion Picture Association of
                    America (MPAA) is one such prominent and
                    influential organization which is a group of six
                    of the biggest movie studios of Hollywood.
                    Hollywood spends considerable amount
                    of its film earnings on efforts to kill piracy.
                    The MPAA identifies individuals or groups
                    involved in piracy and files lawsuits on the
                    grounds of copyright theft. Lawsuits are
                    often expensive and time consuming even
                    in the United States. The losses occurred by
                    the film-makers due to piracy is in millions,
                    but the money gained from settlements
                    and damage claims are minimal because the
                    scene groups and individuals are not that
                    rich to give millions. And hence we don’t see
                    many cases of torrent site and release groups
                    getting arrested. It is just a waste of time for
                    the movie industry.
                    YIFY was around the Scene for many
                    years and no doubt it was on MPAA’s radar, but
                    to trace a group like YIFY is not an easy task.
                    Scene groups leave little or no information
                    about their location or personal details in
                    the open. They use Virtual Private
                    Networks (VPN) to hide their identity on
                    the internet, Internet Relay Chat (IRC) to
                    communicate with fellow pirates and high
                    security FTP servers to share files within the
                    community to process them. They use bots to
                    upload torrents onto the Bittorrent trackers
                    like PublicHD, KickassTorrents, 1337x, The
                    Pirate Bay, and ExtraTorrent.They seed their
                    files onto the Bittorrent networks using
                    dedicated Seedboxes which are situated in
                    a country different from theirs. A seedbox
                    is BitTorrent jargon for a dedicated highspeed
                    server, used exclusively for torrent
                    transfers. This means that the members of
                    the group do not use their private computers
                    to share their files, which keeps their own
                    identity safe. However the group couldn’t
                    stay anonymous for long until October last
                    year when the MPAA cracked down onto the
                    operator of YIFY’s official website YTS.to who
                    happens to be a resident of New Zealand.
                    MPAA is not a government organization and
                    if it wants to take action on YIFY’s operator,
                    it has to proceed to the court. The site was
                    shuttered by a multi-million dollar lawsuit
                    filed in a New Zealand court by the MPAA
                    and the group won’t ever be coming back.
                    YIFY cooperated with the MPAA and settled
                    the matter by exchanging some information.
                    This information will come handy for the
                    MPAA in the future days to come when it
                    cracks down on more pirates. Meanwhile,
                    several imposters make blatant attempts to
                    cash in on the void left by the demise of YIFY,
                    none of them which are as good as YIFY.
