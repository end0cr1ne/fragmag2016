                <div class="question">
                    You wrote Q&A in just 2 months, which is an incredible feat! Were you always a writer at heart?
                    Because completing such an incredible book in just 2 months is nothing short of a miracle!
                </div>
                <div class="answer">
                    No, but this is the first book I ever wrote. I was a reader all my life but when I joined the IFS in
                    1986, which is a full-time government job, the reading habit took a back-seat. I never really
                    thought of myself as a writer. It was only when I was posted in London, between 2000 and 2003 that
                    the writing bug sort of bit me and there were two reasons for that. The first was that, London is
                    such a hub for the world of English language publishing since the world’s top publishers and agents
                    are based in London. Every week you would hear of a new book being launched or a new author being
                    born and that really inspired me. The second inspiration was a number of people in the IFS also
                    trying their hand at fiction and contemporary. Some of my seniors whom I’d never imagined being
                    writers had their books come out and I thought to myself, ‘Can I also write? Do I have a book inside
                    me?’ So that’s how it happened. But I was able to write this book in two months, mainly because of
                    the 35 years of reading that I had done prior to that.<br/>Basically, the fact that they had written
                    fiction inspired me to write fiction but obviously I cannot copy anyone else’s story and to come out
                    with a unique story in my own voice is what I tried to do with my debut novel.

                <div class="question">
                    The book Q&A has won a lot of awards and accolades. Which one of them is closest to your heart?
                </div>
                <div class="answer">
                    The biggest award any writer can get is feedback from his readers in which they say that this is a
                    book that they loved or admired or that changed their lives. That is really what makes writing such
                    a special thing. A character that was living inside your head is now living inside somebody else’s
                    head. What bigger thrill can there be? But yes, the book has won a number of awards. But, one award
                    in South Africa which it got, is called the Boeke prize. The award is a version of UK’s Man Booker
                    Prize and their point is that the Boeke prize is given to high-felutant literary style novels which
                    people buy but do not enjoy or do not read. But, the Boeke prize in South Africa is given to
                    original and accessible writing, that people can relate to, understand and enjoy. To be the first
                    ever Indian recipient of the Boeke prize was quite special because I had just arrived in South
                    Africa as I was posted there as a diplomat and within two weeks of my arrival I was given the Boeke
                    prize and was told that in the history of the Boeke prize, it was the first time an author was
                    present personally to receive it, so that made it all the more special.

                <div class="question">
                    About your other books, Six Suspects and The Accidental Apprentice, they are also being made into
                    movies, what can your share about it with us?
                </div>
                <div class="answer">
                    About Six Suspects, the rights were actually with one particular company for the last 6 years. They
                    changed 4 directors, got a screenplay written but couldn’t get to the production space so I refused
                    to extend the rights and now I have given it to a Chinese company and they’ll be doing the film
                    edition of Six Suspects. As far as The Accidental Apprentice is concerned, I am in a very happy
                    situation where BBC, Los Angeles, is looking to convert it into an English film and Sri Ram
                    Raghavan, the guy who did Badlapur, Agent Vinod and Johnny Gaddar, is writing the screenplay and he
                    will be directing it for Bollywood.

                    What kind of expectations do you have from these movies after Slumdog Millionaire?
                </div>
                <div class="answer">
                    The best approach a writer can have to a cinematic adaptation of his work is that of a distant
                    relative. If you’re too closely involved then it’s also counterproductive because you want to
                    interfere in every process, so I think the slightly detached perspective of a distant relative is
                    the right approach to have. I have full trust in Sri Ram Raghavan and am sure he’ll do a good job. I
                    spoke to him about a week ago and he said that he is still not very comfortable with the screenplay
                    he has done so he is still trying to do some final touches and then he’ll share it with me and we’ll
                    take it forward. I think that both these books are very cinematic.

                <div class="question">
                    Sir, your work as a diplomat has taken you to a lot of places with different traditions and
                    cultures. Which is your favourite country?
                </div>
                <div class="answer">
                    My favourite country is obviously my home country, India. No doubt about that. But when you talk
                    about living abroad, sometimes people think that if you are in a country which has a very low level
                    of living, then you’ll be unhappy and if you’re in an advanced western country, you will be happy. I
                    have never believed that. For me, the quality of a posting is made by the quality of the
                    conversations that you’re able to hold in those countries. If you have smart people with whom you
                    can have a great conversation, then even in a place which isn’t the most advanced in terms of
                    facilities and standard of living, you can have a great time. All of my postings, whether it was at
                    America, South Africa, Ethiopia or Japan, have been very different and unique. My first posting was
                    at Turkey, which was very interesting. My last posting was at Japan, which I think was the most
                    memorable since Japan is a very unique country. They have a unique take on life; it’s a very
                    different way of looking at things. It’s the only country in the world where people go crazy for a
                    month over Cherry blossom season, because people just want to celebrate beauty. The people look at
                    the Cherry blossoms which just blossom for 15 days in a whole year, as an example of the ephemeral
                    nature of human existence. We are flowers that just blossom for a little time and then fade out when
                    new flowers come the next year. Getting inspired by that, they treasure the memory of those 15 days
                    and enjoy the fragrance of that for the rest of the year. So Japan was a fantastic posting.

                <div class="question">
                    What exactly, according to you, makes a book, good?
                </div>
                <div class="answer">
                    As a member of the jury, we were judging for Man Asian literary award. It basically looks at
                    literary writing from all over Asia. So the great thing that it enabled me to do was to sample
                    writings from countries like Mongolia, Cambodia, that otherwise I would not have read. Having
                    sampled writings from all these great countries, what I still couldn’t quite clearly define is the
                    secret of writing a bestseller. Nobody knows that. I think a book is a combination of many things;
                    the plot, the characters, the situation. I think different books appeal to you in a different way..
                    So you cannot say some book is the greatest book you’ve read. I think books also appeal to you at a
                    particular point in time. A book that you appreciated as a child, you might not appreciate as an
                    adult. A book that you appreciate now, you may not have appreciated 5 years ago. Books are very
                    subjective and every book appeals to a different reader in a different way.

                    The book that got the award was by a Korean writer and was about the search for a mother. I thought
                    it was a very human book. It was a book that really captured the poignancy of the relationship
                    between a mother and her daughter. From that point of view, all the judges were united about it. Iit
                    was a very human and poignant book It was very well written and was also able to evoke emotions in
                    all of us about the bond between the mother and her children. We all felt that the book deserved the
                    award.

                <div class="question">
                    Among the young contemporary Indian writers, who is your favorite?
                </div>
                <div class="answer">
                    Well I’ve not read all of them, but I’ve seen the success that Chetan Bhagat, Amish Tripathi,
                    Ravindra Singh, Durjoy Dutta and many other writers have now achieved and it’s very heartening
                    because it shows that the Indian readership is now increasing. 15-20 years ago, the only kind of
                    writing in India was very heavy duty literary writing and readership was also a very elite
                    readership. Now we have a readership that is going into the lower middle classes. Many more people,
                    who didn’t earlier, are now reading novels and books. So from that point of view, I think it’s a
                    good point that our number of readers is increasing. But on the con side, almost anyone can become a
                    writer these days and the kind of quality control that we had in the past is no longer there. I have
                    seen a number of books in the marketplace, in which the grammar is all over the place and it does
                    not make too much sense. Hence, the reader has to differentiate between good writing and bad
                    writing.

                    The theme of our magazine this year is, Kairos. It means a special or opportune moment in time. So
                    in retrospect, is there a moment in time that changed your future and the way you perceive the past?
                </div>
                <div class="answer">
                    Well, there have been many such moments. The first moment would probably be the moment of my birth.
                    The other moments I can think of are, when I graduated from school and got into university, got a
                    job in the IFS, got married, when I had a kid, when my first book was published, when I first got
                    the news that the contract had been accepted, when Slumdog Millionaire came out and won all the
                    awards. These would be some of the most significant moments. In my diplomatic career also I’ve had a
                    number of such moments. I’m not one of those who treasure only one particular moment. To want to
                    live a full life, you have to take everything that your life has been up to now and accept it and
                    carry that memory with you as you move forward. If you just stick to one point in time saying that
                    is my golden period and after that my life is bad, then that wouldn’t be very productive.

                <div class="answer">
                    The youth of the country is really its strength. Since almost 65% of the population is below the age
                    of 25, it’s their hopes, aspirations and their dreams that will power the new emerging India. I
                    think our youth is on the right track. They are innovators, they are creators. It is a huge change
                    in the 21st century because earlier, we were just consumers of material. But now, we are creators.
                    Also, the Prime Minister’s vision of ‘Startup India, Standup India’, that is very important because
                    I think our youth must think of original ideas and creations. That, for me, is the only message I
                    can give to the youth. Don’t be just blind followers. We should think originally, think creatively
                    and make our own path. Today, it’s not the nation with the greatest army or the greatest economy
                    that is going to be the leading nation. It is the nation which is the most innovative that will be
                    the leading nation.
