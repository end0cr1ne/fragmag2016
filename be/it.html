        Our journey started with the inclusion of this one total halfwit; never knew a thing, but boasted
        plenty. He came, he saw
        (and did some pretty stupid things), he conquered! This started an unfortunate chain of events, the
        first of which compelled our
        dear classmate Shravan to become more responsible for his belongings. He is a unique specimen in
        himself; while others leave
        their footwear on the floor outside the lab during practicals, he wraps up his slippers and places it in
        his bag ….. which is placed
        inside another bag! Pretty Awesome Right!?
        This one incidence taking place in the practicals doesn’t mean that the theory lectures are altogether
        uneventful. While
        you can do whatever you want when the teacher faces the board, but when she turns around, the universal
        rule is to SHUT UP!
        not shout ‘Jai Mata Di’ while standing up in front of the whole class. Unfortunately, Anurag failed to
        grasp this simple concept.
        Guys tend to show their muscular strength in sports but that’s not quite what happened in our class.
        Everyone dreams
        of going places, but not everyone ends up in the Casualty Ward at Holy Family after arm wrestling Ambar.
        Now that we have
        spoken about Ambar his ex-homie, Abhinav, cannot go unmentioned. Encroachment of assets earns you a loud
        ramification
        witnessed by everyone. Abhinav learned this the ‘hard’ way. This landed him in the toilet to wash away
        his sins. (Now, here we
        boast our poetic skills)
        But instead of washing away his sins, in the mirror he saw his face;
        there was nothing he could see, but disgrace.
        Then he got angry and broke the mirror on the wall;
        but guess who took the fall.
        The one who took the fall is the one who’s spirits are always ‘high’;
        he left his ID card there for even dimwits to identify.
        This is what we call #Thuglife.
        From practical labs and classrooms to even the washrooms the guys from our class always make their
        presence felt; toh NSS
        camp bhi kya cheez hai!? In kindergarten, we were taught not to play with FIRE, but Ambar was absent!
        “Because some men aren’t logical, some men just want to watch the world BURN.”
        Can Ambar’s present bestie go unmentioned, now that we have talked plenty about Abhinav?
        Lost and Found’s new Location – Panchal’s OLX Account
        Username: PanchLnF
        Lost something? This is the place to go! We are pretty sure,
        this place is frequented by Rohit the most!
        It is not the recognition that BE-IT needs but the recognition that BE-IT deserves. Our contribution to
        the college is tremendous
        in the eyes of all the students who dance to the tune of Moodle submissions. If you ever find Moodle
        unresponsive thank
        Sandesh! Now you know who to contact when you have assignments, submissions, tests and all that shiz.
        Just kidding, fellas;
        you’re still gonna have to do it all!
        Now that we have spoken about the people who are in the class, let’s talk about the people we dearly
        miss.
        One of them was a guy who became a billionaire by collecting money for Xerox. Then there was the
        “helpful” one who provided
        instant solutions for every assignment and question bank that existed. Also, we were gifted brilliant
        football players by our
        seniors; but we are a good class, we are selfless, we added a few more players to them and generously
        passed them on to our
        juniors. And, they helped them get to the finals of the Football Tournament. Such is our gratitude.
        In SE, everyone had come from different FE classes, and some even from diploma. These silly little
        incidents brought
        us together as a class, united us and helped us all showcase our skills in a much effective way! The
        talents that our classmates
        possess are tremendous and these newfound friendships assisted us in achieving greater things!
        Having a class full of all-rounders, we not only have IT’ers performing weird antics, but we also have
        individuals like
        Kaushal, Ronak and Karthik, in the top 10, who have displayed brilliant academic prowess throughout our
        4 years. Coders from
        our class have displayed their brilliance across many events like Rigved in JP Morgan’s Code for Good,
        and Abhinav, Karthik,
        Ronak and Tabish in TCS Code Vita. Karthik, Sitalaxmi and Tanvi stood 1st amongst all Mumbai University
        students in the BNP
        Paribas’ competition: Ace Manager.
        Ronak from our class has been one of the most consistent performers for Robocon and was the Coding
        Leader for the
        year 2014-15. Arush has been in the Design Team of Vaayushastra for the year 2013-14.Our class made
        notable contributions
        to the Students’ Council in the form of Ruchira, the Sponsorship Head, and Sanyukta, the Joint Creative
        Head and FragMag
        Marathi Editor. Before our third year started, it was pre-decided that it would be the last year of ITSA
        after which it would be
        dissolved. But, our classmates slogged it off, revived the IT Week and brought ITSA to reach such new
        heights that the decision
        of dissolution was revoked; and all this was due to their sheer hard work!
        For us, not even the sky is the limit! In addition to academics, we have been performing stupendously
        and winning in all
        other extracurriculars as well! We, as Second Year Students, all came together during Euphoria and
        helped the SE’s win the Best
        Year Dance. We are proud to say that the then SE-IT was one of the major contributors for this dance.
        Performers like Abhishek,
        Ruchi and Sweety have danced in the Paridhaan Team and have represented our college in many festivals
        and events. Abhishek
        has won the Dance Faceoff in TE.
        The Dramatics Club in our college had its first play the previous year, and we are proud to say that
        Tryambak was one
        of the leads of that well-acclaimed play. We also have accomplished musicians, namely Kevin and Rohan
        who play the Piano and
        Drums respectively. Kevin has bagged the first place in the Iran League and Rohan has performed for the
        college band across
        many colleges in Mumbai. During Euphoria, when in TE, Sitalaxmi secured the third place in the
        Interclass Singing Competition.
        Coming to sports, our boys TT team has been winning the interclass Table Tennis Tournaments for the past
        two years.
        We also won the gold for Boys Badminton in SE and the silver in TE. Parth has been awarded the best TT
        and Badminton player
        in SE. The Boys Rink Football team were the runners up in SE. Under the able guidance of our very own
        Coach Kabir Khan,
        Abhishek, the girls Rink Football team won the Girls Rink Football in BE. In SE, the Boys Basketball
        team went on to secure the
        second place in the Interclass Basketball Tournament. The Boys Cricket Team secured the fourth place in
        the Interclass Cricket
        Tournament in BE.
        Now that we are nearly through our three years of togetherness we would like to give away Na-Real awards
        for the class of
