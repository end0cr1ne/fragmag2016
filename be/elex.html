        The 8th of July, 2013 saw the assimilation of a group of souls who had taken up - in their opinion
        - the best form of engineering there was. Six semesters and umpteen subject abbreviations later, they
        realized they were right!
        This is the story of BE Electronics batch of 2016.
        Starting with the most scenic possible view on the 7th floor, SE Elex began its journey towards
        achieving a goal which it achieved only in Third Year.... A classroom of its own. For this batch has
        been
        tossed around classrooms like a table tennis ball in the 6th floor Gymkhana. And the addition of Diploma
        students in the month of August 2013 lent different shades to this group which was beginning to co-exist
        as friends and colleagues.
        Ours was the first batch to be graded by the University’s new CGPA system and boy did we
        rock it. So much so, that out of 10, our topper scored 10.04! Studying for exams was always a group
        effort. Even those who “cannot study out of eBooks” are seen staring at their mobile screens. The most
        nondescript of persons would be the first to ask teachers for question banks. As usual, each question
        will
        be tougher than the next. But that’s where we turn to our best friend...
        TECHMAX!! Also known as ‘This is probably the only book with which I will pass’. These books
        have probably saved more lives than disaster helplines. Hardcore reference book users (do they even
        exist?) cannot downplay the confidence they gain when they see the entire syllabus in one go.
        Assignments were given regularly by teachers, usually all subjects at the same time. But we take it up
        as
        a challenge (Read: One person takes it as a challenge) and complete it before you can say Ctrl+C and
        Ctrl+V.
        Submission days were like picnics and reams of assignment sheets were always present for ‘co-operative
        completion’. ‘This is such a pointless exercise’, he said, as he filled up another page of the
        assignment.
        Vivas... This one word sends down shivers down each
        spine. The exam before the exam. And the one day we realise the importance of time.
        If you are one of the first to exit, be sure to give out sound bytes to your eager ‘fans’.
        Semester endings are usually celebrated with sailing parties. And if you don’t get this, you probably
        aren’t familiar with Bandstand.
        Councils – Groups of students teaming up to organise events and functions as a local college
        chapter of international organisations (Sometimes read as: Certi dude!). Elex 2016 has been at the
        forefront of every major council operating in the college. The core of the Students’ Council 2014-15 was
        from this class as was the IEEE Council of the same year. At the same time, the Project Cell was headed
        by members of Elex 2016, who participated in various technical competitions.

        Technical Teams – Groups of students teaming up to design and develop vehicular and robotic
        devices to compete in national and international level technical competitions (Sometimes read as: Certi
        dude!). E-Yantra, SAE Aero-Design, Baja, Supra, Robocon, Karting, Outback. There is an Elex footprint
        in each of these competitions. When we get going, stuff gets going. This also explains why our class is
        half-empty during lectures because somehow, all of us are busy at the same time.
        Projects are where we have shined since the start. From accelerometer-controlled gestures and
        colour sorting mechanisms to can-filling systems and eye-controlled wheelchairs, we have done it all. If
        you think your project is fancy, drop by our class and reassess.
        As for sports, we have represented the college in football and cricket at the University level,
        securing laurels at various inter-collegiate events.
        At the inter-class level, we have consistently finished in the top two for two consecutive years
        in cricket. At the same time, we have secured various medals in athletics and rink sports. And yes, we
        are the Tug-o-War Kings. In a college with a strong Production presence, that’s saying something. In
        badminton and chess too, we have finished in the top 4 consistently and have been in the reckoning for
        the Sports Trophy for two straight years.
        On the flipside, our football stats are legendary. Frankly, how else can you describe a three-year
        goalless drought! That’s right, this has to be a record that every class from now on wants to beat.
        Last but not the least, Euphoria!
        Elex 2016 has always participated in all events of Euphoria wholeheartedly, whether organising
        or competing. Along with the entire SE, we secured Best Dance in 2014 and won many other events.
        In fashion show too, we finished third in the year 2015 in our first attempt. It is not for nothing that
        our
        performances are looked forward to every year and this year too, we will be going out with a bang!
        A special mention of our Class (and Constant) Representative (Sorry can’t think of anything more).
        Now...
        Four years of assignments (a.k.a copy writing), examinations (like GoT Winters) and placements
        (TCS or Accenture?) later, did we achieve what we set out to? That’s another story altogether. Well,
        nothing more to ramble about, so...
        ....For #OneLastTime... GO ELEX!
