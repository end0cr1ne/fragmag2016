        The eternal question that plagued Shakespeare’s Hamlet, which pursued humanity for ages
        and which haunted us from the moment we gave our board exams, ‘To BE || not to BE’.
        While we faced this conundrum during every submission, at every viva, while writing every
        paper, while checking every result and while battling what we hoped was the last of the KT’s,we
        did finally manage to”DO” the BE. The opalescent populace of the class which first met as
        of a bunch of unruly teens armed with their ignorance and idiosyncrasies which were at first
        insufferable then tolerable and finally endearing and to graduate now as adults with perhaps a
        little less ignorance. Between the tons of segmentation faults and the billions of infinite loops,
        we managed to learn a few things and forget some more. Bound together by papa’s wish to
        have an engineer in the family and of course the love for coding, our camaraderie grew as we
        shared codes and we went from strangers to friends to one large green family.
        A family full of variety and disorder which has the quirky geniuses, the medal decorated
        sportspersons, the know-it-alls and the say-it-alls, the silent ones and the loud ones, the singers
        and the croakers, the dancers and the choreographers, the hermit and the people living in the
        cloud, those ones and the twins the council creators and council wrappers, the debaters, the
        peripatetic over achiever, ….phew! We do enjoy an all-CRCE cachet.
        These four years have taught us more than Tannenbaum or Galvin could ever teach us. We
        survived every storm, every breeze as we sailed through this voyage of wisdom, lunacy, discipline
        and chaos. It coaxed us to overlook the confines of our own gangs and come together as a class
        when the times asked for it. It sparked our creative side, as we all prepared in unison for our
        class dance. The numerous proxies we made for each other, in sickness and in health, taught us
        to have each other’s back all the time. One could even call this a holy expedition as it brought
        light to the atheists when they finally took to kneeling and praying just so that the lectures
        would be called off. It showed us the importance of missing out on a lecture; one day you are absent and
        bam! You become the CR. It taught us to
        be punctual, a minute late and you are banned from
        entering the class, and a minute early, eh! Who comes early? It gave us the wisdom to put in the
        minimal efforts for preparing before any exam, and at the same time to take a more pragmatic
        approach during the exam.
        We are going to miss each and everything; the benches under which you can find any
        sort of stationery in case you forgot something at home, the tables on which we doodled, and
        assignment answers which we always Googled, the washrooms and the Gymkhanas which have
        always served as the perfect weekday getaways, the noise of the printers when they are out of
        cartridge, and the view of the swimming pool at Taj.
        We know, we could all have done justice to our degree, had we written that many lines
        of codes as the number of deliberations we had while planning on a mass bunk. Nevertheless,
        these same discussions made us wise over these years, and we would like to share whatever
        “gyaan” we garnered in the hope that it might help someone stuck somewhere or simply as we
        call it “hand on the torch” or in our case “hand on the algorithm to survive.”
        The transition from pre-JEE exam to post whilestill blurred and distorted in our minds
        and this one entrance exam has scarred many lives. And this post-traumatic stress disorder is
        what makes it all the more taxing to adjust in an entirely new environment in a new college and
        every small negative point is magnified. But the point is that the lift will always be crowded, the
        canteen will always run out of food and you will always have to always climb up the slope(both
        literally and figuratively), however one must know “Happiness can be found, even in the darkest
        of times, if one only remembers to turn on the light.”Besides, we all did eventually warm up to
        the place, gradually so much that it did become our second home.And as the first year went
        by, and some friendships and ground rules were established, one important thing we learnt
        in the second year was to pick up a good Wi-Fi spot. Not only should the signal be strong
        enough in that location but that spot should be discreet enough to hide you from the teachers,
        or should give you time enough to run away from the teachers. And then after all the dodging
        and the fleeing, came the penultimate year. All the seminars and the seniors giving advice and
        counselling made us really think about why we even chose to come into this branch, college,
        field, earth! We started questioning our existence. But take it from us, it is completely and
        absolutely fine to not know what you want to do after graduation, and it is perfectly normal to
        feel lost amidst MS, MBA and hopelessness. Fighting against all odds and struggling with all
        the ineptness, the final year made us realize the value of the memories molded and waiting to
        be molded. Nothing sums up the final year better than this quote, “All good things must come
        to an end, but I wouldn’t have wanted it to end any other way or with any other people.”
        All the memories are eternally entrenched in our minds. The euphoria after winning the
        dance trophy, the fear after that time we were caught bunking and the sheer unbelief and relief
        after we got off, the joy of clearing a KT, the jitters before every result, our ability to postpone
        anything and everything (thankfully not the Fragmag’s deadline for this article, though we were
        given a few, or a little more than a few, warnings before we actually submitted), the sadness
        after losing a match and the happiness of standing together as one is what makes BE COMPS.
        We waited for four years to bear us to the crossroads of our journey only to realize that in the
        darkness of the uncertainty prevailing about our future the class is the mosaic that leads us on.
        As an era ends, a feeling of sadness prevails in our hearts and we realize what Khalil Gibran
        rightly said, ’love knows not of its own depth until the hour of separation’. We paved the path
        along the slope we climbed and as we approach the countdown towards our final ascent, we
        log out not as batch mates but as a great khandaan with countless memories which we’ll never
        forget for AULD LANG SYNE!
