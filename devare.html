                <div class="question">
                    You studied in this institution back in the late eighties. Could you give us an insight into your
                    journey here?
                </div>
                <div class="answer">
                    This college was in its budding stages then, and we as the second batch (1985-1989), had the onus of
                    building its reputation. It was a revolutionary phase for us. Back in the day, things were very
                    different from what they are now. Our faculty was excellent but the infrastructure was still
                    developing; I’m so proud to see how advanced it is now. There was tremendous unity amongst us; we
                    worked as a team, guided by our seniors and faculty. The diploma college, quite experienced then,
                    collaborated with and helped us significantly. One of the perks of studying here is that you get to
                    enjoy the scenic beauty of Bandstand. I still reminisce relishing the famous ‘Bandstand Chai’
                    outside college.

                <div class="question">
                    Having graduated with an engineering degree, how did you transition to the financial sector?
                </div>
                <div class="answer">
                    I would like to summarize my ethos in three words – aspire, arise and achieve. I completed my
                    in-plant training at Godrej, after which they offered me the opportunity to join them permanently
                    and I accepted it with alacrity. I also worked with the sales team there for a short span, during
                    which time I started enhancing my knowledge and exploring avenues to maximize my potential. I always
                    aspired to learn more. Intrigued by the financial sector, I did my Master in Management Studies
                    (MMS) in Finance from the Narsee Monjee College of Management Studies, affiliated to the Mumbai
                    University then. Through campus recruitment, I was placed with Mahindra & Mahindra Limited and since
                    then have been working with the Mahindra Group, for about 24 years now.

            <div class="qset">
                <div class="question">
                    How have you evolved as a person over the last 24 years in Mahindra and Mahindra Limited? Are you
                    happy with where you’re currently at?
                </div>
                <div class="answer">
                    I am happy and content with where I am now. Of course, learning never stops; one grows as one
                    learns. Even today I consider myself a student with miles to go ahead of me. I have worked on
                    several projects and assignments across the different sectors of the Mahindra Group. One of the best
                    things about working with an established organization like Mahindra, which is a federation or
                    conglomerate of several companies, is the extensive knowledge and business exposure it gives you. I
                    was fortunate to be a member of the founding team that set up Mahindra Insurance Brokers Limited
                    around 12 years ago. It is making its mark and we have great aspirations for the future.

                    This is the first time our college is felicitating an alumnus for his achievements. How does it feel
                    to be receiving ‘The Distinguished Alumni Award’ today?
                </div>
                <div class="answer">
                    I am deeply humbled and touched by the fact that this institution has considered me for this
                    prestigious award. It is great to know that your alma mater recognizes and appreciates your
                    achievements. I dedicate this award to my family, faculty, friends and colleagues who have helped me
                    rise. Their contributions have been instrumental in making me who I am today and it is with great
                    pride that I accept this award today on their behalf.

                    We would like to know what inspires and drives you to keep going. What is your philosophy?
                </div>
                <div class="answer">
                    Like I said earlier, my friends and family have played a huge role in my development. When you
                    aspire, arise and achieve, there are many people that influence, inspire and help you in myriad
                    ways. What drives me is the need to contribute to and build our nation. We should never restrict our
                    thinking; instead, strive to do as much as we can to make a larger impact on society. In our Group
                    we follow a simple philosophy: ‘The Rise Philosophy’– enabling people to rise. It has 3 main
                    pillars: accepting no limits, alternative thinking, and driving positive change. If incorporated in
                    daily life, it is bound to boost growth and development, both of self and society at large.

                    ‘Bharat Awakens’ is a publication close to the heart of Mahindra and Mahindra. Could you elucidate
                    the idea behind its conception?
                </div>
                <div class="answer">
                    ‘Bharat Awakens’ is a book we launched in our Financial Services Sector. Our target is to always
                    provide viable solutions to our customers, who are at the heart of our business. There is a large
                    segment of our society that is underserved. By creating solutions for them, we strive to make a
                    larger impact on society. Thus, Mahindra also caters to the underprivileged and has influenced and
                    shaped many lives. These are the stories that ‘Bharat Awakens’ was created to highlight and promote.

                    What is the one piece of advice that you would like to give today’s youth, especially those in our
                    college?

                <div class="answer">
                    Being passionate about whatever you are pursuing is the key to success. You should do something you
                    believe in and dedicate all your heart and mind to it, using core values as your compass. It is only
                    when you are excited and passionate about something, that you will be driven to giving it your best
                    and be able to excel and sustain excellence.
