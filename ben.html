            <div class="question">
                The field of AI started as a quest to build human level intelligence. But with time, the scientific
                community shifted more towards narrow AI. You have always been a strong supporter of AGI and strive to
                build a community around it. What according to you are the reasons why we deviated from the core belief
                of the field?
            </div>
            <div class="answer">
                Until recently computing hardware was so weak that using it to implement advanced AI or even early-stage
                AGI, would have been very difficult. So researchers and developers gravitated toward things that were
                easier to do using the materials available. This is quite understandable, really... But what made less
                sense was the lack of understanding, on the part of many past AI researchers, that advanced AI and AGI
                WOULD be possible once hardware advanced a little further. This lack of understanding was resultant from
                the absence of a good, widely accepted theory of how intelligence works... Most researchers in the field
                STILL operate without any decent theory of how intelligent works, but now hardware is better, so many of
                them can get interesting results anyway!

        <div class="qset">
            <div class="question">
                ‘Ten years to singularity’ is a book authored by you, released in 2014, in which you say that we are
                only 10 years away from the singularity if we really try. How likely is OpenCog to be the for-runner to
                meet that target?
            </div>
            <div class="answer">
                OpenCog is a serious contender, but not the only contender. Positing exact numerical odds would seem
                silly. I would say our odds of being the “first to AGI” are above 20% and below 90%. If we manage to
                secure some solid funding this year, then that will shift the odds upwards. I think we have by far the
                best AGI design on the planet, but we are not the best funded AGI project on the planet -- not at this
                point anyway. So there are factors in our favor, and factors against us... if one wants to look at
                things as an “AGI race”, which isn’t necessarily the most useful perspective...

        <div class="qset">
            <div class="question">
                Is the architecture of OpenCog different from the way human cognition works? Or are they similar?
            </div>
            <div class="answer">
                Similar but different! The high level architecture of OpenCog is modeled after human cognition, but all
                the particulars are different. The specific representational mechanisms are different, as are the
                specifics of the learning algorithms we use.
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="qset">
            <div class="question">
                Can you explain the concept of cognitive synergy in brief?
            </div>
            <div class="answer">
                To achieve a reasonable level of general intelligence using a practical amount of computational
                resources, a mind needs multiple cognitive algorithms associated with multiple types of memory -- and
                these algorithms need to be able to interfere subtly and appropriately with each others’ internals, so
                as to guide each other away from hopeless combinatorial explosions and other resource-wasting phenomena.
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="qset">
            <div class="question">
                In your book, ‘The Hidden Pattern’, you’ve said that the mind is made of patterns. Can these patterns be
                recorded and transferred into a machine? Wouldn’t that be good way at emulating intelligence at the
                human level and beyond?
            </div>
            <div class="answer">
                Uploading human minds into machines is technologically possible and almost sure to happen in the future.
                It will provide amazing new ways of living and thinking and feelings for human minds. On the other hand,
                uploaded humans are ultimately not going to be as intelligent as AGI minds that are NOT held back by the
                need to emulate the messy, constraining specifics of the human mind-brain...

            <div class="question">
                Lets say, we get to singularity. What is something that may happen in such a situation that not too many
                people know?
            </div>
            <div class="answer">
                The Singularity will be a Singularity of experience, just as much as one of technology. People will have
                access to states of consciousness and modes of awareness -- new ways of FEELING, RELATING, thinking and
                being that they cannot now conceive...

            <div class="question">
                What do you think will be the reaction to an AGI with human level intelligence from a societal aspect?
            </div>
            <div class="answer">
                People will love AGIs 1000x more than they now love their smartphones. Of course, there may be nasty or
                offensive or dangerous AGIs as well. But if AGIs are programmed and taught to be compassionate and
                helpful, people will bond with them emotionally and intellectually, very tightly... We bond very well
                with dogs and even toy animals, and they are not remotely as compassionate, responsive, helpful and
                interesting as AGIs will...
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="qset">
            <div class="question">
                Also, say we apply AGI’s on the economic platforms; stocks, bonds, etc, replacing human brokers and
                investment bankers, how do you think the stock market will react to such an event and the effects of
                different AGI’s competing in the stock market?
            </div>
            <div class="answer">
                Markets will become even more complex, and even less humanly comprehensible. And then the AGIs will
                modify financial markets into something quite different, something we may not even be able to
                recognize.... This may happen at the same time as the current money economy goes down the toilet, due to
                Drexlerian nanotech and other advances massively reducing the need to exchange work or money to support
                one’s everyday life...

                The theme of our magazine this year is Kairos which refers to ‘ultimate moments’. As a futurologist,

            <div class="answer">
                An AGI that can hold a long conversation with you, giving a feeling of true understanding. A life
                extension pill that lets you live to 150 on average --- thus viably letting you “live long enough to
                live forever” (i.e. longevity escape velocity, the Methuselarity !! ...) A 3D printer that lets you
                print any ordinary matter you wish, by laying down arbitrary molecules in arbitrary specified

                I love India! The food is great, and there is a great sense of life and humanity and passion. And so
                many people with interesting philosophical views. Definitely India is the philosophical capital of the
                world, which is pretty cool to me ... I love deep, inventive, creative thinking -- and India has lots of

                Is there anything you’d like to tell the youth of the country?

            <div class="answer">
                The future is not just something that happens to us. It is ours to create. And national, racial and
                class boundaries are decreasingly relevant in the modern era. As one example, I helped found an
                AI/robotics company in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia (iCog Labs) and am consistently impressed with the smarts
                and skills of the best young technical university graduates there... Of course it’s more difficult to
                get in a position to make a huge science or tech contribution if you are raised in a poor village with
                low quality education. But it still is possible if you push hard enough and get a bit of luck. Society
                is still cruel and unfair in many ways, yet much less so than in past generations... The future will be
                created by everyone on the planet -- but most of all by those with imagination, creativity, strong will
                and the capability for hard work.

                My favorite musical artist is Buckethead What a genius. Soundtrack for the Singularity! Favorite movie
                is “Brazil” -- a fantastic dystopian SF film, unrelated to the country of Brazil. Favorite book is hard
                to identify -- there are too many. Favorite authors are Dostoevsky, Philip K. Dick, Henry Miller ... I
                guess .... These folks deeply explored the essence of what it is to be human, to be alive...
